{"prompt": "Create a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nFew-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.", "category": "write", "response": "This paper introduces FewJoint, the first few-shot learning (FSL) benchmark for joint dialogue understanding.

", "category": "write", "response": "Living in Flagstaff, Arizona has been an eye-opening experience for me as a first-year college student. The city, nestled in the Coconino National Forest, offers a unique blend of natural beauty and small-town charm. From the moment I arrived, I was captivated by the stunning landscapes, friendly locals, and vibrant community. However, as I settled into my new home, I also noticed some challenges and quirks that make Flagstaff a truly distinct place to live.\n\nOne of the most striking features of Flagstaff is its breathtaking natural surroundings. The city is surrounded by the majestic San Francisco Peaks, which provide a stunning backdrop to everyday life. As I walk to class, I am constantly reminded of the awe-inspiring beauty that surrounds me. The crisp mountain air and the scent of pine trees create a sense of tranquility that is hard to find in other college towns. As I gaze at the snow-capped peaks, I am reminded of the words of John Muir, who once said, \"The mountains are calling and I must go.\" Indeed, living in Flagstaff has made me appreciate the power and majesty of nature in a way that I never had before.\n\nIn addition to its natural beauty, Flagstaff is also home to a vibrant and diverse community. The city has a rich history and a strong sense of identity, which is evident in its numerous cultural events and festivals. One of my favorite experiences in Flagstaff was attending the annual \"First Friday Art Walk,\" where local artists showcase their work in downtown galleries. As I wandered from one gallery to another, I was struck by the creativity and talent of the artists. The vibrant colors and intricate details of their work transported me to another world, where imagination knows no bounds. This experience reminded me of the words of Pablo Picasso, who once said, \"Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.\" Indeed, living in Flagstaff has allowed me to immerse myself in a community that celebrates creativity and expression.\n\nDespite its many charms, living in Flagstaff also comes with its fair share of challenges. One of the most notable challenges is the harsh winter weather. As a first-year student from a warmer climate, I was not prepared for the freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall that Flagstaff experiences. I vividly remember my first encounter with a snowstorm. As I walked to class, the snowflakes fell gently from the sky, creating a winter wonderland."}

Its facade, adorned with sleek lines and shimmering windows, seemed to whisper tales of prestige and secrets. Within the walls of this high-rise, a peculiar community thrived, a community that had been dwelling there for as long as anyone could remember. They were the immortal cats.\n\nThese felines, with their piercing eyes and sleek fur, had witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, the evolution of mankind. They had seen empires crumble and wars rage, yet they remained untouched by the passage of time, forever suspended in their feline grace. Their existence was a mystery, an enigma that fascinated the residents of the co-op.\n\nThe residents, a diverse mix of artists, writers, and eccentric souls, had come to accept the presence of these immortal cats as a part of their everyday lives. They had grown accustomed to the cats' silent observations, their aloof demeanor, and their uncanny ability to always be present, no matter the hour.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow upon the city, a meeting was called in the co-op's grand ballroom. The residents gathered, their eyes filled with curiosity and anticipation, as the cats gracefully padded into the room, their tails held high in regal fashion.\n\nAt the head of the gathering was Mr. Whiskers, the elder of the immortal cats. His fur, once vibrant and full, now carried the wisdom of countless centuries. He cleared his throat, and the room fell into a hushed silence.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" Mr. Whiskers began, his voice a low, melodic purr. \"We have gathered here tonight to discuss the future of our coexistence. For too long, we have remained hidden, our immortality a secret known only to a select few. But I propose a change.\"\n\nThe room buzzed with murmurs of intrigue, as the residents leaned forward, their eyes fixed on Mr. Whiskers.\n\n\"We shall reveal ourselves to the world,\" he continued, his eyes gleaming with determination. \"No longer shall we hide in the shadows, confined to this high-rise. It is time for the immortal cats to take their place in the tapestry of New York City.\"\n\nThe residents exchanged glances, their minds racing with the implications of such a revelation.

What drives us to face such peril, such uncertainty?\n\nSome may call it greed, others may say it's power that fuels our desires. But I've come to realize it's something deeper. It's the need to be more than just a pawn, to carve out our own destiny amidst the chaos. To leave a mark, however small, upon this vast tapestry of existence.\n\nWe're not born heroes, you see. We're shaped by the choices we make, the paths we tread. And sometimes, those choices lead us down dark and treacherous roads. We stumble, we fall, but we rise again. It's that resilience, that determination to keep going, that separates us from the rest.\n\nBut it's not just about survival. No, there's something more. Something intangible, yet so powerful. It's the bonds we forge along the way, the friendships, the loves, the losses. They shape us, mold us into something greater than ourselves. They give us purpose, a reason to keep fighting, even when all seems lost.\n\nSo here I sit, in this tavern, nursing my drink and reflecting upon the battles fought and the battles yet to come. The gods may play their games, but I'll be damned if I let them dictate my fate. I'll fight, I'll endure, and I'll leave my mark upon this world, no matter"}
