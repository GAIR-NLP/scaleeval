{"prompt": "Verify the correctness of the given statement.\n\n\"For all integers j and k, if j and k are odd, then jk is odd.\"", "category": "math", "response": "The given statement is correct.\n\nTo verify this, we can use the definition of odd numbers. An odd number is any integer that can be expressed in the form 2n + 1, where n is an integer. \n\nLet's assume j and k are odd integers. So, we can express them as j = 2a + 1 and k = 2b + 1, where a and b are integers.\n\nNow, let's find the product of j and k: jk = (2a + 1)(2b + 1).\n\nExpanding this expression, we get: jk = 4ab + 2a + 2b + 1.\n\nWe can rewrite this expression as: jk = 2(2ab + a + b) + 1.\n\nSince 2ab + a + b is an integer, let's call it m. So we have: jk = 2m + 1.\n\nThis shows that jk can be expressed in the form 2n + 1, where n = m, which means that jk is odd.\n\nTherefore, we have verified that for all integers j and k, if j and k are odd, then jk is odd."}

For the second cell in the first row, you have (n-1) choices (since you have already used one element in the first cell). Similarly, for the third cell in the first row, you have (n-2) choices.\n\nFollowing this pattern, for the first cell in the second row, you again have n choices. For the second cell in the second row, you have (n-1) choices. For the third cell in the second row, you have (n-2) choices.

Since there are 100 pence in a pound, we divide the cost by 100:\n625 pence / 100 = \u00a36.25 per gallon\n\nFinally, we multiply the total gallons by the cost per gallon to find the total cost of fuel:\n0.435 gallons * \u00a36.25 per gallon = \u00a32.72\n\nTherefore, the cost of fuel for a 14-mile journey in heavy traffic would be approximately \u00a32.72."}

How many M&Ms did Mary get total?", "category": "math", "response": "First find the total number of M&Ms in the second bag: 7930843 M&Ms + 12 M&Ms = <<7930843+12=7930855>>7930855 M&Ms\nThen divide the number of M&Ms in the first bag by 2 to find the number in the third bag: 7930843 M&Ms / 2 = <<7930843/2=3965421.5>>3965421.5 M&Ms\nThen round that number down to find the number of M&Ms in the third bag: 3965421 M&Ms\nThen add the number of M&Ms in each bag to find the total number: 3965421 M&Ms + 7930855 M&Ms + 7930843 M&Ms = <<3965421+7930855+7930843=19877119>>19877119 M&Ms. Answer: \\boxed{19877119}."}

How many colors of crayons did Beatrice buy in all?", "category": "math", "response": "The six packets had a total of 6 x 7927834 = <<6*7927834=47567004>>47567004 pieces of crayons.\nThe four packets had a total of 4 x 16 = <<4*16=64>>64 pieces of crayons.\nTherefore, Beatrice bought a total of 47567004 + 64 = <<47567004+64=47567068>>47567068 pieces of crayons. Answer: \\boxed{47567068}."}
{"prompt": "Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. If her gym teacher tells her to run 7637264 laps and each lap is 0.25 km, how many milliliters of water will Hannah need to drink?", "category": "math", "response": "First find the total distance Hannah runs in km: 7637264 laps * 0.25 km/lap = <<7637264*0.25=1909316>>1909316 km\nThen multiply the distance she runs by the amount of water she needs to drink per km to find the total amount of water she needs to drink: 60 ml/km * 1909316 km = <<60*1909316=114558960>>114558960 ml. Answer: \\boxed{114558960}."}
{"prompt": "Jane planted a beanstalk in her backyard. After the first week, it was 3 inches tall. It doubled in height the second week. It grew another 4 inches in the third week. How tall was the beanstalk after 3 weeks?", "category": "math", "response": "After the second week, the beanstalk was 3 inches * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 inches tall.\nAfter the third week, the beanstalk was 6 inches + 4 inches = <<6+4=10>>10 inches tall. Answer: \\boxed{10}."}
{"prompt": "The bananas at the supermarket cost $0.80 each, or a bunch for $3.00.  Jenny buys 10 bunches that average 8241786 bananas per bunch. How much money, in dollars, did she save by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually?", "category": "math", "response": "First find the total number of bananas Jenny bought: 10 bunches * 8241786 bananas/bunch = <<10*8241786=82417860>>82417860 bananas\nThen multiply that number by the cost per banana to find the total cost if she bought them individually: 82417860 bananas * $0.80/banana = $<<82417860*0.80=65934288>>65,934,288\nThen multiply the number of bunches she bought by the cost per bunch to find the total cost if she bought them in bunches: 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $<<10*3=30>>30\nThen subtract the cost of the bunches from the cost of the individual bananas to find the savings: $65,934,288 - $30 = $<<65934288-30=65934258>>65,934,258. Answer: \\boxed{65,934,258}."}
{"prompt": "A $5081959 watch was put on sale so that Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price. He then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price that he bought it. What is the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price?", "category": "math", "response": "Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75/100 * $5081959 = $<<75/100*5081959=3811469.25>>3811469.25.\nHe then sold it at 120/100 * $3811469.25 = $<<120/100*3811469.25=4573753.1>>4573753.1.\nThe discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend is $5081959 - $4573753.1 = $<<5081959-4573753.1=508206.9>>508206.9.\nThe percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend is (508206.9/5081959) * 100 = <<(508206.9/5081959)*100=9.999999999999998>>9.999999999999998%.\nThe percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price is 10%.
