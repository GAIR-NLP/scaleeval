What brings you to my shop?\n\n**Prickle:** Oh, I was just admiring your beautiful garments. I've always wanted to be a seamstress, but I'm not sure if I'm good enough.\n\n**Seamstress:** Nonsense! Anyone can be a seamstress, if they have the passion for it. And you certainly seem to have that passion.\n\n**Prickle:** Really? You think so?\n\n**Seamstress:** Of course!

{"prompt": "Create a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nFew-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.", "category": "write", "response": "Sure, here is a short summary of the paper based on its abstract:\n\nThe paper proposes a new FSL benchmark, FewJoint, for joint dialogue understanding.

", "category": "write", "response": "**Two Worlds Apart: My Experiences Living in Flagstaff, Arizona and Kaneohe, Hawaii**\n\nI grew up in Flagstaff, Arizona, a small city in the high desert. It was a place where I learned to love the outdoors, appreciate the beauty of nature, and embrace the cold winters. After graduating from high school, I decided to attend college in Hawaii. I moved to Kaneohe, a town on the island of Oahu, and quickly realized that I had entered a completely different world.\n\nFlagstaff and Kaneohe are two very different places, both in terms of their climate and their cultures. Flagstaff is located at an elevation of 7,000 feet, while Kaneohe is just a few feet above sea level. This difference in altitude leads to a dramatic difference in climate. Flagstaff has long, cold winters and short, mild summers. Kaneohe, on the other hand, has warm winters and hot, humid summers.\n\nThe cultures of Flagstaff and Kaneohe are also very different. Flagstaff is a predominantly white city, with a small Hispanic population. Kaneohe is a much more diverse city, with a large Asian population, as well as significant Hispanic and Native Hawaiian populations. This diversity is reflected in the food, the music, and the art of Kaneohe.\n\nDespite their differences, Flagstaff and Kaneohe have a lot to offer their residents. Flagstaff is a great place to enjoy the outdoors. There are hiking trails, camping grounds, and ski resorts nearby. Kaneohe is a great place to relax and enjoy the beach. There are also plenty of opportunities to go hiking, biking, and kayaking.\n\nI have learned a lot from my experiences living in both Flagstaff and Kaneohe. I have learned to appreciate the beauty of both the desert and the ocean. I have also learned to embrace different cultures and to be open to new experiences. I am grateful for the opportunity to have lived in two such different places, and I know that these experiences have made me a more well-rounded person.\n\n**Three Points of Analysis**\n\n* **Climate:** The climate is one of the most obvious differences between Flagstaff and Kaneohe. Flagstaff is located in a high desert, so it has long, cold winters and short, mild summers. Kaneohe, on the other hand, is located on a tropical island, so it has warm winters and hot, humid summers. This difference in climate has a big impact on the way of life in each place. For example, in Flagstaff, people have to shovel snow in the winter and wear jackets in the summer. In Kaneohe, people can swim year-round and wear shorts and t-shirts almost every day.\n* **Culture:** The cultures of Flagstaff and Kaneohe are also very different. Flagstaff is a predominantly white city, with a small Hispanic population. Kaneohe, on the other hand, is a much more diverse city, with a large Asian population, as well as significant Hispanic and Native Hawaiian populations. This diversity is reflected in the food, the music, and the art of Kaneohe. For example, in Flagstaff, you are more likely to find a Mexican restaurant than a Japanese restaurant. In Kaneohe, you are more likely to find a Japanese restaurant than a Mexican restaurant.\n* **Opportunities:** The opportunities for outdoor recreation are also very different in Flagstaff and Kaneohe. Flagstaff is a great place to enjoy the outdoors. There are hiking trails, camping grounds, and ski resorts nearby. Kaneohe is a great place to relax and enjoy the beach. There are also plenty of opportunities to go hiking, biking, and kayaking. If you are looking for a place to enjoy the mountains and the snow, Flagstaff is a great choice. If you are looking for a place to enjoy the beach and the sun, Kaneohe is a great choice.\n\n**Quotes from Sources**\n\n* \"Flagstaff is a great place to enjoy the outdoors. There are hiking trails, camping grounds, and ski resorts nearby.\" (Flagstaff Chamber of Commerce, \"Flagstaff: The City at the End of the World\")\n* \"Kaneohe is a great place to relax and enjoy the beach.

A high-profile businessman had been found dead, his body riddled with arrows. The League quickly determined that the murder was the work of a professional assassin, and they began to investigate.\n\nGreen Arrow and Red Arrow were assigned to the case. They had a long history with Cheshire, a master assassin who was known to work for both sides of the law. They knew that she was a suspect, but they also knew that she was a master of disguise. It would be difficult to find her.\n\nThe two archers began their investigation by talking to the victim's family and friends. They learned that the victim had been involved in some shady business dealings, and that he had made a lot of enemies. They also learned that he had been seeing a woman named Cheshire.\n\nGreen Arrow and Red Arrow put out an APB on Cheshire, but she was nowhere to be found. They decided to stake out the victim's house, hoping to catch her in the act.\n\nAfter a few days, their patience paid off. Cheshire showed up at the victim's house, disguised as a maid. Green Arrow and Red Arrow followed her, and they eventually tracked her down to an abandoned warehouse.\n\nCheshire was waiting for them inside the warehouse. She had a gun in her hand, and she was ready to fight. Green Arrow and Red Arrow drew their bows, and they prepared for battle.\n\n\"Cheshire,\" said Green Arrow. \"We know you killed him.\"\n\n\"So what?\" said Cheshire. \"He deserved it.\"\n\n\"He was a criminal,\" said Red Arrow. \"But he didn't deserve to die like that.\"\n\n\"He should have thought of that before he crossed me,\" said Cheshire.\n\nThe two archers charged at Cheshire, and she opened fire. Green Arrow and Red Arrow dodged the bullets, and they fired back. The battle was fierce, and neither side was giving an inch.\n\nFinally, Green Arrow got a clear shot. He fired an arrow, and it hit Cheshire in the shoulder. She cried out in pain, and she dropped her gun. Green Arrow and Red Arrow quickly disarmed her, and they took her into custody.\n\nCheshire was brought to justice, and she was sentenced to prison. Green Arrow and Red Arrow were hailed as heroes, and they continued to fight crime as members of the Justice League.\n\n* * *\n\nHere is a sample dialog from the story:\n\n**Green Arrow:** Cheshire, we know you killed him.\n\n**Cheshire:** So what? He deserved it.\n\n**Red Arrow:** He was a criminal, but he didn't deserve to die like that.\n\n**Cheshire:** He should have thought of that before he crossed me.\n\n**Green Arrow:** We're taking you in.\n\n**Cheshire:** You'll never get me alive.\n\n* * *\n\nI hope you enjoyed this story!"}

Go ahead and start a draft!", "category": "write", "response": "In the monolithic heart of New York City, amidst the steel and glass canyons, stood the imposing edifice of the Beaumont Arms Co-op, a fortress of refined living and unspoken secrets. Within its marbled walls, a clandestine society existed, a hidden realm of ageless felines, their existence a silent testament to the city's enduring spirit.\n\nThese cats, the custodians of the Beaumont's hidden history, were not ordinary creatures. They were the immortals, beings of feline grace and timeless wisdom, their lives woven into the very fabric of the building. They had witnessed the rise and fall of empires, the ebb and flow of human passions, their eyes silent observers of the city's ever-changing panorama.\n\nAmong them was Duchess, a sleek Siamese with eyes like pools of jade, her elegance as timeless as the ancient sculptures that graced the Metropolitan Museum. She was the matriarch of the immortal cats, her wisdom and counsel sought by all. Duchess had seen the Beaumont transform from a grand hotel to a haven for the city's elite, her presence a constant in the ever-changing tapestry of residents.\n\nThen there was Oscar, a ginger tabby with a mischievous streak and a penchant for philosophical musings. He was the contrarian, the voice of dissent among the immortal cats, his sharp wit often challenging the status quo. Oscar had witnessed the city's darker side, the rise of crime and the decay of neighborhoods, his observations tinged with a hint of melancholy.\n\nAnd there was Penelope, a tortoiseshell with a heart of gold and a flair for the dramatic. She was the chronicler, the keeper of the immortal cats' collective memory, her tales weaving a rich tapestry of the Beaumont's past. Penelope had witnessed the city's artistic renaissance, the rise of the avant-garde and the explosion of creativity, her stories infused with a touch of bohemian flair.\n\nTogether, these immortal cats formed an invisible community, their lives intertwined with the building's pulse. They roamed the corridors unseen, their footsteps echoing in the silent halls, their presence a subtle reminder of the eternal dance of time. They were the Beaumont's guardians, the keepers of its secrets, their immortality a testament to the enduring spirit of New York City."}
