        "Reasoning": " Here is my analysis:\n\nSubmission 1 shows step-by-step work following the logic of the word problem correctly. It calculates number of no-shows, number of attendees, number of gift bags needed based on attendees, and total cost accurately. Though explanation could be more detailed, the work is systematic and aligns with principles needed to solve the problem.\n\nSubmission 2 incorrectly calculates number of attendees by multiplying total invited by 3/4 rather than subtracting no-shows. It then calculates cost based on this incorrect number. The approach does not follow the word problem logic.\n\nBased on the criteria focusing on logical coherence, accuracy, and systematically following relevant mathematical principles, Submission 1 is better.\n\n1\n1"
