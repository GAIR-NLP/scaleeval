Submission 1 has a more coherent flow, while submission 2 explores consequences in greater detail. However, submission 2 showcases better logical structure by outlining multiple scenarios and broader impacts. The arguments are well-developed with evidence of critical thinking about potential consequences. In contrast, submission 1 lacks depth in analyzing alternatives. Overall, submission 2 meets more criteria indicators of \"proficient\" reasoning, with structured arguments and well-reasoned assumptions. The ideas are organized logically, easy to follow, and address complexities around technology advancements and operation outcomes. The order of presentation did not affect my judgement.\n\n2\n\n2"

Submission 1 explores more hypotheticals about Newton's specific contributions, while submission 2 outlines broader advancements Newton could have catalyzed. Submission 1 shows creativity, but some ideas like formulating evolutionary theory seem anachronistic. Submission 2 covers more fields and is structured more logically as numbered points. Both rely on assumptions without concrete evidence. However, submission 2 feels slightly more grounded in showcasing the potential application of Newton's skills and scientific approach. The key criteria for mastery focus on comprehensive topics coverage, addressing complexities, and demonstrating deep understanding of logical reasoning. Submission 2 better meets these criteria.\n\n2\n\n2"
