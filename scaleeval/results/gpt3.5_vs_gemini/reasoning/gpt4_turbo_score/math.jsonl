Each submission uses the correct formula to find the perimeter and correctly divides this by Gary's walking speed to find the time spent walking.\n\nSubmission 1 offers a step-by-step explanation, which includes finding the perimeter first and then dividing by Gary's speed. Submission 2 presents the calculation in a more concise manner and includes the use of mathematical symbols to directly show the operations performed. Both submissions are correct and align with the mathematical principles relevant to the question, reflecting a sound understanding and a systematic approach.\n\nBased on the criteria provided, both responses would be rated at least a \"4\" for being proficient, as they are logically coherent, accurate, and align with the mathematical principles of the problem. Neither submission falls short in terms of providing the correct solution or outlining a clear approach.\n\nTherefore, neither submission is better than the other in terms of accuracy and adherence to the mathematical principles.\n\n0\n\n0"

        "Reasoning": "Submission 1 calculates the total number of M&Ms correctly for the second bag but fails to address that M&Ms are discrete units and cannot be halved, resulting in an incorrect total involving a fractional M&M. This submission does not round down the number of M&Ms in the third bag, which is necessary since you cannot have half an M&M. This is a significant error in approach.\n\nSubmission 2 corrects this by rounding down the number of M&Ms in the third bag, aligning with the discrete nature of the items being counted. It then correctly adds the quantities to find the total number of M&Ms. This submission demonstrates a better understanding of the mathematical principles involved, particularly the concept that M&Ms are discrete items and cannot be halved.\n\nAccording to the criteria, Submission 2 is \"Proficient\" or \"Mastery\", while Submission 1 is \"Developing\" due to the fractional M&M error.\n\n2\n\n2"

        "Reasoning": "Both Submission 1 and Submission 2 correctly calculate the total number of crayons in the packets. They each accurately multiply the number of crayons in the six packets by 7927834 and in the four packets by 16, and then sum the results. Neither submission contains computational errors or omissions, and both provide a clear step-by-step solution. Both responses align closely with the mathematical principles relevant to the question and neither falls short in providing a systematic approach. Neither submission provides in-depth insights or explores alternative methods, which is not required in this straightforward computational problem. Therefore, both submissions demonstrate a mastery level of understanding according to the provided criteria.\n\nSince both responses are equally correct, coherent, and complete, neither submission is better than the other.\n\n0\n\n0"

        "Reasoning": "To evaluate the submissions, we'll assess the accuracy of the mathematical solution, clarity of explanation, and alignment with the criteria's definitions. Both submissions calculate the height of the beanstalk correctly, arriving at 10 inches after 3 weeks. They both follow a clear and systematic approach by breaking down the growth week by week.\n\nSubmission 1 uses a straightforward, step-by-step explanation that shows the growth progression in a simple format. It is accurate and aligns with the 'Proficient' level, as it is logically coherent and accurate.\n\nSubmission 2 also provides the correct answer and includes the calculations within the text, using placeholders and a box to emphasize the final answer. This method adds a slight visual aid to the reader, which could be seen as enhancing comprehension, aligning with the 'Mastery' level.\n\nComparing the two, Submission 2 might be considered slightly better as it offers a more polished presentation of the solution. However, the difference is marginal as both submissions are correct and clear.\n\n2\n\n2"
