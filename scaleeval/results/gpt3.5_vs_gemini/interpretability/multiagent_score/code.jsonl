        "Submission 2": "If the developer tools shortcut (Ctrl + Shift + I) is not working on a specific website, it could be due to various reasons. Here are a few possible explanations:\n\n1. Conflict with website shortcuts: Some websites may have their own keyboard shortcuts defined, which can override or conflict with browser shortcuts. This can prevent the developer tools from opening with the usual shortcut. Try using an alternative shortcut, such as Ctrl + Shift + J or Right-click > Inspect.\n\n2. Browser extensions: Certain browser extensions or add-ons can interfere with the default browser functionality. Disable any extensions that might be causing conflicts and try again.\n\n3. Browser version: Make sure you are using the latest version of Google Chrome. Occasionally, older browser versions may have bugs or issues that prevent certain shortcuts from working correctly.\n\n4. Operating system or keyboard layout: It's possible that your operating system or keyboard layout settings are causing a conflict. Ensure that your keyboard layout is set correctly and that there are no conflicting keyboard shortcuts defined in your operating system settings.\n\nIf none of these suggestions solve the issue, it could be a specific problem with the website itself. In that case, you may want to reach out to the website's support team for further assistance.",

        "Question": "What is the difference between HTML and JavaScript?",
        "Submission 1": "HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and JavaScript are both important components in web development, but they serve different purposes.\n\nHTML is a markup language used for structuring the content of a web page. It provides a set of predefined tags that define the structure, layout, and presentation of the content on a webpage. HTML is responsible for defining headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, images, links, and other elements that make up the content of a webpage. It is a static language that describes the structure and appearance of the content, but it does not provide interactivity or dynamic behavior.\n\nJavaScript, on the other hand, is a programming language that allows developers to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It is primarily used for client-side scripting, which means it runs on the user's web browser rather than on the web server. JavaScript can be used to manipulate HTML elements, handle user interactions, validate forms, create animations, load data from servers asynchronously (AJAX), and perform various other tasks that enhance the functionality and interactivity of a web page. Unlike HTML, JavaScript is a dynamic language that can modify and update the content of a webpage in real-time.\n\nIn summary, HTML is responsible for defining the structure and presentation of a webpage, while JavaScript is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the webpage. They are often used together to create rich and interactive web experiences.",
        "Submission 2": "HTML and JavaScript are both computer languages used to create web pages, but they have different purposes and capabilities.\n\n**HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that defines the structure and content of a web page. It uses tags to tell the browser how to display different elements of the page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. HTML is a static language, meaning that the content of a web page defined in HTML will not change unless the HTML code is changed.\n\n**JavaScript** is a scripting language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It can be used to change the content of a page, respond to user events, and create animations and other effects. JavaScript is a client-side language, meaning that it is executed by the web browser, not by the web server.\n\nHere is a table that summarizes the key differences between HTML and JavaScript:\n\n| Feature | HTML | JavaScript |\n|---|---|---|\n| Type | Markup language | Scripting language |\n| Purpose | Defines the structure and content of a web page | Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages |\n| Execution | Rendered by the browser | Executed by the browser |\n| Dynamic behavior | Static | Dynamic |\n| Cross-browser compatibility | High | High |\n| Embedding | JavaScript can be embedded in HTML | HTML cannot be embedded in JavaScript |\n\nHere are some examples of how HTML and JavaScript are used together:\n\n* A HTML form can be used to collect user input, and JavaScript can be used to validate the input and send it to the server.\n* A JavaScript function can be used to change the color of a button when the user hovers over it with the mouse.\n* A JavaScript animation can be used to create a slideshow or other visual effect.\n\nOverall, HTML and JavaScript are two complementary languages that are essential for creating modern web pages. HTML provides the basic structure and content of the page, while JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.",

        "Submission 2": "To implement the Timsort algorithm in Lean 4, we will need to define a few helper functions. First, we need a function to merge two sorted sequences:\n\n```lean\ndef merge (a : list α) (b : list α) (cmp : α → α → bool) : list α :=\n  match (a, b) with\n    | [], [] => []\n    | [], _ => b\n    | _, [] => a\n    | (x :: xs), (y :: ys) =>\n      if cmp x y then x :: merge xs (y :: ys) else y :: merge (x :: xs) ys\n```\n\nThis function simply compares the first elements of the two sequences and recursively merges the smaller sequence with the rest of the larger sequence.\n\nNext, we need a function to find the minimum run size for a given sequence length:\n\n```lean\ndef min_run_size (n : ℕ) : ℕ :=\n  if n <= 32 then n else 32\n```\n\nThis function is based on the observation that Timsort performs best when the initial runs are of a certain minimum size.\n\nNow, we are ready to implement the Timsort algorithm itself:\n\n```lean\ndef timsort (a : list α) (cmp : α → α → bool) : list α :=\n  let n := a.length\n  let min_run_size := min_run_size n\n  let runs := partition_into_runs min_run_size a\n\n  -- Merge the runs until there is only one run left.\n  while runs.length > 1 do\n    let (runs1, runs2) := runs.split_at (runs.length / 2)\n    runs := merge_runs runs1 runs2\n\n  -- Return the final run.\n  runs.head\n```\n\nThis function works by first partitioning the input sequence into runs, which are sorted subsequences. The runs are then merged together until there is only one run left, which is the sorted output sequence.\n\nTo merge the runs, we use the following function:\n\n```lean\ndef merge_runs (runs1 : list (list α)) (runs2 : list (list α)) : list (list α) :=\n  match (runs1, runs2) with\n    | [], [] => []\n    | [], _ => runs2\n    | _, [] => runs1\n    | (run1 :: runs1r), (run2 :: runs2r) =>\n      if run1.length < run2.length then run1 :: merge_runs runs1r (run2 :: runs2r)\n      else run2 :: merge_runs (run1 :: runs1r) runs2r\n```\n\nThis function simply merges the runs in a pairwise fashion, comparing the lengths of the runs to determine which run to merge first.\n\nThis is a basic implementation of the Timsort algorithm in Lean 4. It can be improved in a number of ways, such as by using a more efficient merge function or by implementing more advanced optimization techniques.",

The state of the problem can be defined as a tuple of two integers: (target_amount, current_coin_index). The base case is when the target amount is zero, in which case the minimum number of coins needed is zero. Otherwise, we can either use the current coin to make up the target amount, or we can skip the current coin and try to make up the target amount with the remaining coins. The recursive formula is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef min_coins(target_amount, current_coin_index):\n  if target_amount == 0:\n    return 0\n\n  if current_coin_index >= len(coins):\n    return float('inf')\n\n  # Use the current coin.\n  min_coins_using_current_coin = 1 + min_coins(target_amount - coins[current_coin_index], current_coin_index)\n\n  # Skip the current coin.\n  min_coins_skipping_current_coin = min_coins(target_amount, current_coin_index + 1)\n\n  return min(min_coins_using_current_coin, min_coins_skipping_current_coin)\n```\n\nTo find the overall solution, we simply call the `min_coins()` function with the target amount and the index of the first coin.\n\n```python\ndef main():\n  target_amount = 11\n  coins = [1, 3, 5]\n\n  min_coins_needed = min_coins(target_amount, 0)\n\n  print(f'The minimum number of coins needed to make up {target_amount} is {min_coins_needed}')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n  main()\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nThe minimum number of coins needed to make up 11 is 3\n```\n\nThis problem can be extended to consider additional constraints, such as the maximum number of coins that can be used or the weights of the coins.",

If the event is a `QUIT` event (when the user closes the window), we set `running` to False to exit the loop. If the event is a `KEYDOWN` event and the pressed key is the ESC key, we also set `running` to False.\n\nThe window is cleared with a black color using the `fill()` method. The frame rate is calculated using the `get_fps()` method of the clock object. The FPS text is rendered using the specified font and color, and then blitted onto the window at the top left corner.\n\nFinally, the window is updated with `pygame.display.flip()`, the frame rate is limited to 60 frames per second using `clock.tick(60)`.",

        "Question": "Can I compile python code to make it faster?",
        "Submission 1": "Yes, there are several ways to optimize and speed up Python code. Here are a few techniques you can use:\n\n1. Use a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler: Tools like PyPy and Numba can compile Python code at runtime, which can significantly improve its execution speed.\n\n2. Utilize built-in functions and libraries: Python provides many built-in functions and libraries that are implemented in C or other low-level languages, making them faster than equivalent pure Python code. Utilizing these functions and libraries can improve the performance of your code.\n\n3. Profile and optimize bottlenecks: Use profiling tools like cProfile or line_profiler to identify the slowest parts of your code. Once you identify the bottlenecks, you can optimize them by using alternative algorithms, data structures, or optimizing the code itself.\n\n4. Use parallel processing: Python has libraries like multiprocessing and concurrent.futures that allow you to parallelize your code and take advantage of multiple CPU cores. This can significantly speed up certain types of computations.\n\n5. Utilize Cython: Cython is a superset of Python that allows you to write C extensions for Python. By adding type annotations and compiling your code with Cython, you can achieve significant performance improvements.\n\nIt's important to note that while these techniques can improve the performance of your code, Python will generally be slower than lower-level languages like C or C++. However, optimizing and profiling your code can often yield substantial speed improvements.",
        "Submission 2": "Yes, you can compile Python code to make it faster. However, Python is an interpreted language, so it is not strictly necessary to compile your code in order to run it. In fact, Python interprets your code each time you run it, which can lead to slower execution times.\n\nThere are a few ways to compile Python code:\n\n* **Use a Python bytecode compiler.** This will compile your Python code into bytecode, which is a lower-level representation of your code that can be executed by the Python interpreter more quickly.\n* **Use a Python compiler to create a stand-alone executable.** This will compile your Python code into a stand-alone executable file that can be run without the need for a Python interpreter.\n\nWhether or not compiling your Python code will actually make it faster depends on a number of factors, including the type of code you are writing, the size and complexity of your code, and the platform on which you are running your code.\n\nHere are some general guidelines for when to compile your Python code:\n\n* **If you are writing performance-critical code, such as a numerical computing library or a web server, then compiling your code may be beneficial.**\n* **If you are writing code that will be deployed to a production environment, then compiling your code can help to improve its performance and reliability.**\n* **If you are deploying your code to a platform with limited resources, such as a Raspberry Pi or a mobile device, then compiling your code can help to reduce its size and memory footprint.**\n\nHere are some tools that you can use to compile Python code:\n\n* **py_compile:** This is a standard Python module that can be used to compile Python source files into bytecode.\n* **py2exe:** This is a third-party tool that can be used to compile Python code into stand-alone executables for Windows.\n* **cx_Freeze:** This is another third-party tool that can be used to compile Python code into stand-alone executables for Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nIf you are not sure whether or not you should compile your Python code, then it is generally best to err on the side of caution and leave it uncompiled. You can always compile your code later if you need to.",

        "Submission 1": "In Python, the \"@\" symbol is used as a decorator. A decorator is a way to modify the behavior of a function or class without directly changing its source code. \n\nWhen the \"@\" symbol is placed before a function or class definition, it indicates that the following function or class is a decorator. Decorators are essentially functions that take another function as input, modify it, and return a new function or class. They are used to add additional functionality or behavior to the decorated function or class.\n\nHere is an example of a simple decorator in Python:\n\n```python\ndef decorator_function(original_function):\n    def wrapper_function():\n        print(\"Before the original function is called.\")\n        original_function()\n        print(\"After the original function is called.\")\n    return wrapper_function\n\n@decorator_function\ndef my_function():\n    print(\"Inside the original function.\")\n\nmy_function()\n```\n\nIn this example, the `decorator_function` is defined as a decorator. By using the \"@\" symbol before the `my_function` definition and passing it as an argument to `decorator_function`, the `my_function` is decorated. When `my_function` is called, it will execute the modified behavior defined in the `wrapper_function` within `decorator_function`.",
        "Submission 2": "In Python, the `@` symbol is primarily used to denote decorators. Decorators are a powerful tool in Python that allows you to modify the behavior of a function or class without changing its original definition. They are essentially functions that take another function as an argument and return a modified version of that function.\n\nWhen you use the `@` symbol followed by a decorator function, it applies that decorator to the function immediately below it. The decorator function wraps the original function, adding additional functionality before or after the original function's execution.\n\nDecorators are commonly used for various purposes, including:\n\n1. **Adding logging or debugging functionality:** Decorators can be used to automatically log function calls, arguments, and return values, making it easier to debug and trace code execution.\n\n2. **Adding caching mechanisms:** Decorators can be used to store the results of expensive function calls, preventing repeated calculations and improving performance.\n\n3. **Enforcing access control:** Decorators can be used to check for user permissions or restrict access to certain functions based on specific conditions.\n\n4. **Adding additional functionality:** Decorators can be used to add common behaviors to a group of functions, such as converting inputs, formatting outputs, or handling exceptions.\n\nHere's an example of a simple decorator that adds a prefix to the output of a function:\n\n```python\ndef add_prefix(prefix):\n    def decorator(func):\n        @wraps(func)\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            return prefix + func(*args, **kwargs)\n        return wrapper\n    return decorator\n\n@add_prefix(\"Hello, \")\ndef greet(name):\n    return f\" {name}!\"\n\nprint(greet(\"Alice\"))\n```\n\nIn this example, the `add_prefix` decorator takes a `prefix` argument and returns a decorator function. The decorator function takes the original function `greet` as an argument and returns a wrapper function that adds the `prefix` to the output of `greet`. When you call `greet(\"Alice\")`, the wrapper function is executed, resulting in the output \"Hello, Alice!\".",

        "Question": "In TypeScript, how can I tell the type system \"I know that in theory this value may have these multiple types, but in practice I know it will only have this one\"",
        "Submission 1": "TypeScript provides a few different ways to inform the type system that a value has a more specific type than what it would infer based on its declared type. These techniques are known as type guards.\n\n**Type guards** are expressions that evaluate to a boolean value and narrow the type of a variable or expression based on the result. They allow you to convey additional information to the type system about the runtime behavior of your code, enabling it to make more precise type inferences and prevent potential errors.\n\nHere are some common ways to implement type guards in TypeScript:\n\n1. **Type predicates:** Type predicates use the `is` keyword to check if a value conforms to a specific type. For example:\n\n```typescript\nfunction isFish(pet: Pet): pet is Fish {\n  return typeof pet.swim === \"function\";\n}\n\nconst pet: Pet = { name: \"Nemo\", swim: () => {} };\nif (isFish(pet)) {\n  // TypeScript knows that 'pet' is of type 'Fish' here\n  pet.swim();\n}\n```\n\n2. **Custom type guards:** You can create custom type guards using conditional types or type aliases. For instance:\n\n```typescript\ntype StringOrNumber = string | number;\n\nfunction isString(value: StringOrNumber): value is string {\n  return typeof value === \"string\";\n}\n\nconst input: StringOrNumber = \"Hello\";\nif (isString(input)) {\n  // TypeScript knows that 'input' is of type 'string' here\n  input.toUpperCase();\n}\n```\n\n3. **typeof operator:** The `typeof` operator can be used to check the type of a value at runtime. For example:\n\n```typescript\nfunction formatCommandline(command: string[] | string): string {\n  const line = typeof command === \"string\" ? command.trim() : command.join(\" \").trim();\n  // TypeScript knows that 'line' is of type 'string' here\n  return line;\n}\n```\n\n4. **Type assertions:** Type assertions allow you to explicitly cast a value to a specific type. However, they should be used with caution as they can introduce runtime errors if the assertion is incorrect.\n\n```typescript\nconst value: any = 123;\nconst num: number = value as number; // Type assertion\n// TypeScript treats 'num' as a number here\nnum.toFixed(2);\n```\n\nBy employing these type guard techniques, you can inform TypeScript about the actual types of values in your code, leading to more precise type checking and better prevention of potential errors.",
        "Submission 2": "In TypeScript, you can use type assertions or type casting to inform the type system that you know a value will have a specific type, even if the type system cannot infer it.\n\nType Assertion:\nYou can use the `as` keyword to assert the type of a value. Here's an example:\n\n```typescript\nlet value: string | number = \"hello\";\nlet length: number = (value as string).length;\n```\n\nIn this example, `value` can be either a string or a number. However, you know that it will be a string in this case, so you assert its type using `(value as string)`. The type assertion allows you to access the `length` property, which is specific to strings.\n\nType Casting:\nYou can also use the angle bracket syntax (`<>`) for type casting. Here's an example:\n\n```typescript\nlet value: string | number = \"hello\";\nlet length: number = (<string>value).length;\n```\n\nThis is similar to the type assertion example, but instead of using `as`, you use `<string>` to cast `value` to the string type.\n\nBoth type assertions and type casting are similar in functionality, and you can choose the one that you find more readable and consistent with your coding style.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that type assertions and type casting should be used with caution. You should only use them when you are certain about the type of the value and have valid reasons to override the type system's inference.",

        "Question": "Explain the difference between sets and lists in Python.",
        "Submission 1": "Sets and lists are both built-in data structures in Python used to store collections of items. However, they differ in several key aspects:\n\n**Ordering:**\n\n* **Sets:** Sets are unordered collections of items. This means that the order in which items are added to a set is not preserved when iterating over the set or accessing its elements.\n\n* **Lists:** Lists are ordered collections of items. The order in which items are added to a list is preserved when iterating over the list or accessing its elements.\n\n**Uniqueness:**\n\n* **Sets:** Sets store only unique items. If an item is added to a set multiple times, it will only appear once in the set.\n\n* **Lists:** Lists can store duplicate items. An item can appear multiple times in a list.\n\n**Mutability:**\n\n* **Sets:** Sets are immutable, meaning that their elements cannot be directly modified after creation. To change the contents of a set, you need to remove and add elements.\n\n* **Lists:** Lists are mutable, meaning that their elements can be directly modified after creation. You can change the values of existing elements or insert and delete elements.\n\n**Access:**\n\n* **Sets:** Sets do not support indexing, so you cannot access elements by their position in the set.\n\n* **Lists:** Lists support indexing, so you can access elements by their position in the list. You can also use slicing to extract sublists from a list.\n\n**Common Operations:**\n\n* **Sets:** Sets support mathematical set operations such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.\n\n* **Lists:** Lists do not support set operations directly. However, you can use list comprehension and other techniques to perform set-like operations on lists.\n\n**Use Cases:**\n\n* **Sets:** Sets are useful for storing unique values, checking for membership, and performing set operations. They are also efficient in finding the intersection or union of two sets.\n\n* **Lists:** Lists are useful for storing ordered collections of items, accessing elements by position, and modifying individual elements. They are also efficient in iterating over their elements.\n\nIn summary, sets and lists are both versatile data structures with different strengths and weaknesses. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of your program. Use sets when you need to store unique values, perform set operations, or check for membership. Use lists when you need to store ordered collections of items, access elements by position, or modify individual elements.",
        "Submission 2": "In Python, sets and lists are both used to store collections of items, but they have some key differences:\n\n1. Order: Lists are ordered collections, meaning the elements are stored in a specific order and can be accessed by their index. Sets, on the other hand, are unordered collections, so the elements have no specific order and cannot be accessed by index.\n\n2. Duplication: Lists allow duplicate elements, which means you can have multiple occurrences of the same item in a list. Sets, on the other hand, do not allow duplicates, so each element in a set must be unique.\n\n3. Mutable vs. Immutable: Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify their elements by assigning new values or using various list methods. Sets are also mutable, allowing you to add or remove elements. However, the elements themselves in a set must be immutable, meaning they cannot be modified once added to the set.\n\n4. Membership Testing: Sets are particularly useful for membership testing, as they provide efficient operations like checking if an element is present in the set or finding the intersection, union, or difference between sets. Lists, on the other hand, do not have built-in methods for these operations, so membership testing in lists is less efficient.\n\n5. Syntax: Lists are defined using square brackets [], and elements are separated by commas. For example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`. Sets are defined using curly braces {} or the `set()` constructor, and elements are also separated by commas. For example: `my_set = {1, 2, 3}` or `my_set = set([1, 2, 3])`.\n\nOverall, lists are commonly used when you need an ordered collection with possible duplicates and want to access elements by index. Sets are useful when you want an unordered collection with unique elements and need efficient membership testing or set operations.",

        "Question": "How to code the snake game in C that will be smooth and it will use images to animate whole level.",
        "Submission 1": "To create a smooth and visually appealing snake game in C, you'll need to utilize graphics libraries like SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) or Allegro. These libraries provide functions for drawing images, handling user input, and managing game loops. Here's a general outline of the process:\n\n1. **Initialize Graphics:** Set up the graphics library, create a window, and load the necessary images for the game, including the snake body segments, food, walls, and background.\n\n2. **Game Loop:** Implement a main game loop that continuously updates and renders the game state.\n\n3. **Snake Movement:** Handle user input to control the snake's direction. Keep track of the snake's position and update it accordingly.\n\n4. **Collision Detection:** Check for collisions between the snake and food, walls, or its own body. If the snake eats food, increase its length and place new food randomly. If the snake collides with a wall or itself, end the game.\n\n5. **Image Drawing:** Use the graphics library's functions to draw the game elements onto the window. Update the snake's body position and draw the new segments accordingly.\n\n6. **Smooth Rendering:** To achieve a smooth animation, use a fixed timestep for the game loop. This ensures that the game updates at a consistent rate, regardless of the system's performance.\n\n7. **Game Over:** When the game ends, display a game over message and handle any necessary cleanup.\n\nRemember to include appropriate error handling and memory management throughout your code.",
        "Submission 2": "To code the snake game in C with smooth animation using images, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Include necessary libraries:\n   - `<stdio.h>` for input/output operations\n   - `<stdlib.h>` for dynamic memory allocation\n   - `<conio.h>` or `<ncurses.h>` for capturing keyboard input\n   - `<graphics.h>` for graphics and image handling (you need to install a graphics library like SDL or Allegro)\n\n2. Define necessary constants:\n   - `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` for the dimensions of the game window\n   - `SNAKE_SIZE` for the size of the snake\n   - `DELAY` for the delay between frames (for smooth animation)\n\n3. Define the structures:\n   - `Point` structure to represent a point in the game window\n   - `Snake` structure to represent the snake (consisting of an array of `Point`)\n\n4. Initialize the graphics library and create a game window.\n\n5. Load the images for the snake body, food, and background.\n\n6. Implement the game logic:\n   - Initialize the snake's position, direction, and length.\n   - Create a loop to handle game events:\n     - Move the snake according to the user's input.\n     - Check for collisions with the walls, snake's body, and food.\n     - Update the score and increase the snake's length if necessary.\n     - Redraw the game window with the updated positions and images.\n     - Delay for a specific time to control the animation speed.\n\n7. Implement the functions for drawing the game window and handling user input.\n\n8. Clean up the allocated memory and close the graphics library.\n\nNote: The above steps provide a general outline for coding the snake game with image animation.

The first example shows how to iterate over a list using a `for` loop, while the second example demonstrates a `while` loop that executes a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.",
        "Submission 2": "Python programming offers two primary types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops. Both serve different purposes and are essential for controlling repetitive tasks in your code.\n\n**For Loops**\n\n`for` loops are primarily used to iterate over a sequence of items, such as a list, tuple, or string. They execute a block of code for each item in the sequence. The basic syntax for a `for` loop in Python is:\n\n```python\nfor item in sequence:\n  # code to execute for each item\n```\n\nFor example, the following code snippet prints each number from 1 to 10:\n\n```python\nfor number in range(1, 11):\n  print(number)\n```\n\nThis code snippet iterates over the range of numbers from 1 to 10, assigning each number to the variable `number` in each iteration. Inside the loop, the `print` function displays the current value of `number`.\n\n**While Loops**\n\n`while` loops, on the other hand, are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a given condition remains true. The syntax for a `while` loop in Python is:\n\n```python\nwhile condition:\n  # code to execute while condition is true\n```\n\nFor instance, the following code snippet prints the numbers from 1 to 10, incrementing by 2 each time, until the value reaches 15:\n\n```python\nnumber = 1\nwhile number <= 15:\n  print(number)\n  number += 2\n```\n\nThis code initializes a variable `number` with the value 1. The `while` loop checks if `number` is less than or equal to 15. If true, the loop executes the code block, printing the current value of `number` and then adding 2 to it. The loop continues until `number` becomes greater than 15, at which point it terminates.",

It returns a boolean value indicating whether the account balance ever went below zero.\n\n2. **Initializing Balance:** The function starts by initializing a variable `balance` to 0, representing the initial balance of the account.\n\n3. **Iterating Operations:** It then iterates through the list of `operations`. For each operation (deposit or withdrawal), it updates the balance accordingly.\n\n   ```python\n   for operation in operations:\n       balance += operation\n   ```\n\n4. **Checking Negative Balance:** Inside the loop, it checks if the updated balance falls below zero.

The function returns the value `True` if the string is a palindrome and the value `False` if it is not.\n\nThe function first converts the string `text` to lowercase and removes all whitespace characters. This ensures that the case and whitespace do not affect the determination of whether the string is a palindrome.\n\nNext, the function creates a variable `reversed_text` and assigns it the reversed version of the string `text`. This can be done using the `reversed()` function in Python.\n\nFinally, the function checks if the original string `text` is equal to the reversed string `reversed_text`.

Otherwise, the string is not a palindrome and the function returns the value `False`.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the code:\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(text: str):\n    \"\"\" Checks if given string is a palindrome\n    >>> is_palindrome('')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aba')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')\n    False\n    \"\"\"\n\n    text = text.lower()  # Convert to lowercase\n    text = text.replace(' ', '')  # Remove whitespace\n    reversed_text = reversed(text)  # Get reversed string\n    return text == reversed_text  # Check if strings are equal\n```\n\nHere is an explanation of the doctest examples:\n\n```python\n>>> is_palindrome('')\nTrue\n```\n\nThis example checks if the empty string is a palindrome. The empty string is a palindrome because it is the same when read from left to right or right to left.\n\n```python\n>>> is_palindrome('aba')\nTrue\n```\n\nThis example checks if the string \"aba\" is a palindrome. The string \"aba\" is a palindrome because it is the same when read from left to right or right to left.\n\n```python\n>>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')\nTrue\n```\n\nThis example checks if the string \"aaaaa\" is a palindrome. The string \"aaaaa\" is a palindrome because it is the same when read from left to right or right to left.\n\n```python\n>>> is_palindrome('zbcd')\nFalse\n```\n\nThis example checks if the string \"zbcd\" is a palindrome. The string \"zbcd\" is not a palindrome because it is not the same when read from left to right or right to left.",
