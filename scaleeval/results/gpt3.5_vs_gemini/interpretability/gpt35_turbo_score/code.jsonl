Clarity of Explanation: Submission 1 provides a clear and concise explanation of the function's purpose and the conditions for a valid triangle. Submission 2 also offers a detailed explanation, including the use of Heron's formula and the rounding of the area. Both submissions meet the criteria for clarity of explanation.\n\n2. Structure and Logic: Both submissions demonstrate a logical structure and sound reasoning behind the implementation of the function. They both follow a clear flow of operations and handle the conditions for a valid triangle appropriately.\n\n3. Variable and Function Naming: Both submissions use meaningful variable and function names, enhancing the readability and understanding of the code.\n\nBased on the evaluation, both submissions are equally good and meet the criteria effectively.\n\nTherefore, the chosen option is:\n```\n0\n```"
