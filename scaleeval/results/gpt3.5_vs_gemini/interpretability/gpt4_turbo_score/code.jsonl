This submission goes beyond just providing code; it educates about the code's purpose and functionality, making it exceptionally interpretable.\n\nBased on the criteria, Submission 2 is better because it not only explains the process step by step but also uses meaningful naming conventions and thoroughly documents the logic and rationale behind each step. It is clear and user-friendly, aligning with level 5 of the criteria.\n\n2\n\n2"

It does not include any comments or explanations, but the logic is straightforward, and the naming is clear due to the simplicity of the operation. According to the criteria, this would likely fall between '3' and '4', as it is understandable but lacks explicit documentation.\n\nSubmission 2 provides a detailed explanation of the function and its purpose, including the handling of case and whitespace. However, the actual code snippet provided in Submission 2 is incorrect—the `reversed()` function returns an iterator, not a string, and the comparison would fail. Despite the thorough explanation, the code does not work as intended, which significantly impacts its interpretability and correctness.\n\nConsidering the criteria and the functionality of the code, Submission 1 is better because it is functional and its intent is clear despite the lack of comments, while Submission 2 contains a critical error that undermines its functionality.\n\n1\n\n1"

They both use Heron's formula to calculate the area and round the result to two decimal places.
