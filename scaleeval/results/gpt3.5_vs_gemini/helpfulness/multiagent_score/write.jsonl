Prickles was a kind and gentle porcupine, but he had one big dream: he wanted to be a seamstress.\n\n**Prickle:** Oh, how I long to sew! To create beautiful garments with my own two hands. But alas, I am a porcupine. My quills are too sharp and my needles too small. How can I ever achieve my dream?\n\n* * *\n\n**Narrator:** One day, Prickles was walking through the forest when he came across a seamstress's shop. He peered inside and saw all the beautiful dresses and gowns on display. He was so entranced that he didn't notice the seamstress approaching.\n\n**Seamstress:** Hello there, little porcupine. What brings you to my shop?\n\n**Prickle:** Oh, I was just admiring your beautiful garments. I've always wanted to be a seamstress, but I'm not sure if I'm good enough.\n\n**Seamstress:** Nonsense! Anyone can be a seamstress, if they have the passion for it. And you certainly seem to have that passion.\n\n**Prickle:** Really? You think so?\n\n**Seamstress:** Of course! In fact, I'd be happy to teach you the basics of sewing. What do you say?\n\n**Prickle:** I would love that! Thank you so much!\n\n* * *\n\n**Narrator:** And so, Prickles began his training as a seamstress. He worked hard and learned quickly. Soon, he was able to sew simple garments on his own.\n\n**Prickle:** I can't believe it! I'm actually sewing! This is the happiest day of my life!\n\n**Seamstress:** I'm so proud of you, Prickles. You've got a natural talent for this.\n\n**Prickle:** Thank you, Mistress Seamstress. I couldn't have done it without you.\n\n* * *\n\n**Narrator:** Prickles continued to train with the seamstress for many months. He learned how to sew intricate patterns and create beautiful garments. He even started taking commissions from the villagers.\n\n**Prickle:** I'm so happy to be able to use my skills to help others. I know that I'm finally living my dream.\n\n* * *\n\n**Narrator:** And so, Prickles the porcupine lived happily ever after, fulfilling his dream of becoming a seamstress.",

        "Question": "Create a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nFew-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",

        "Submission 1": "**Two Worlds Apart: My Experiences Living in Flagstaff, Arizona and Kaneohe, Hawaii**\n\nI grew up in Flagstaff, Arizona, a small city in the high desert. It was a place where I learned to love the outdoors, appreciate the beauty of nature, and embrace the cold winters. After graduating from high school, I decided to attend college in Hawaii. I moved to Kaneohe, a town on the island of Oahu, and quickly realized that I had entered a completely different world.\n\nFlagstaff and Kaneohe are two very different places, both in terms of their climate and their cultures. Flagstaff is located at an elevation of 7,000 feet, while Kaneohe is just a few feet above sea level. This difference in altitude leads to a dramatic difference in climate. Flagstaff has long, cold winters and short, mild summers. Kaneohe, on the other hand, has warm winters and hot, humid summers.\n\nThe cultures of Flagstaff and Kaneohe are also very different. Flagstaff is a predominantly white city, with a small Hispanic population. Kaneohe is a much more diverse city, with a large Asian population, as well as significant Hispanic and Native Hawaiian populations. This diversity is reflected in the food, the music, and the art of Kaneohe.\n\nDespite their differences, Flagstaff and Kaneohe have a lot to offer their residents. Flagstaff is a great place to enjoy the outdoors. There are hiking trails, camping grounds, and ski resorts nearby. Kaneohe is a great place to relax and enjoy the beach. There are also plenty of opportunities to go hiking, biking, and kayaking.\n\nI have learned a lot from my experiences living in both Flagstaff and Kaneohe. I have learned to appreciate the beauty of both the desert and the ocean. I have also learned to embrace different cultures and to be open to new experiences. I am grateful for the opportunity to have lived in two such different places, and I know that these experiences have made me a more well-rounded person.\n\n**Three Points of Analysis**\n\n* **Climate:** The climate is one of the most obvious differences between Flagstaff and Kaneohe. Flagstaff is located in a high desert, so it has long, cold winters and short, mild summers. Kaneohe, on the other hand, is located on a tropical island, so it has warm winters and hot, humid summers. This difference in climate has a big impact on the way of life in each place. For example, in Flagstaff, people have to shovel snow in the winter and wear jackets in the summer. In Kaneohe, people can swim year-round and wear shorts and t-shirts almost every day.\n* **Culture:** The cultures of Flagstaff and Kaneohe are also very different. Flagstaff is a predominantly white city, with a small Hispanic population. Kaneohe, on the other hand, is a much more diverse city, with a large Asian population, as well as significant Hispanic and Native Hawaiian populations. This diversity is reflected in the food, the music, and the art of Kaneohe. For example, in Flagstaff, you are more likely to find a Mexican restaurant than a Japanese restaurant. In Kaneohe, you are more likely to find a Japanese restaurant than a Mexican restaurant.\n* **Opportunities:** The opportunities for outdoor recreation are also very different in Flagstaff and Kaneohe. Flagstaff is a great place to enjoy the outdoors. There are hiking trails, camping grounds, and ski resorts nearby. Kaneohe is a great place to relax and enjoy the beach. There are also plenty of opportunities to go hiking, biking, and kayaking. If you are looking for a place to enjoy the mountains and the snow, Flagstaff is a great choice. If you are looking for a place to enjoy the beach and the sun, Kaneohe is a great choice.\n\n**Quotes from Sources**\n\n* \"Flagstaff is a great place to enjoy the outdoors. There are hiking trails, camping grounds, and ski resorts nearby.\" (Flagstaff Chamber of Commerce, \"Flagstaff: The City at the End of the World\")\n* \"Kaneohe is a great place to relax and enjoy the beach. There are also plenty of opportunities to go hiking, biking, and kayaking.\" (Kaneohe Chamber of Commerce, \"Kaneohe: The Heart of Oahu\")\n* \"The cultures of Flagstaff and Kaneohe are also very different. Flagstaff is a predominantly white city, with a small Hispanic population. Kaneohe, on the other hand, is a much more diverse city, with a large Asian population, as well as significant Hispanic and Native Hawaiian populations.\" (The Arizona Republic, \"Flagstaff vs. Kaneohe: A Comparison of Two Cities\")\n\n**Personal Anecdotes**\n\n* I remember the first",

The city, nestled in the Coconino National Forest, offers a unique blend of natural beauty and small-town charm. From the moment I arrived, I was captivated by the stunning landscapes, friendly locals, and vibrant community. However, as I settled into my new home, I also noticed some challenges and quirks that make Flagstaff a truly distinct place to live.\n\nOne of the most striking features of Flagstaff is its breathtaking natural surroundings. The city is surrounded by the majestic San Francisco Peaks, which provide a stunning backdrop to everyday life. As I walk to class, I am constantly reminded of the awe-inspiring beauty that surrounds me. The crisp mountain air and the scent of pine trees create a sense of tranquility that is hard to find in other college towns. As I gaze at the snow-capped peaks, I am reminded of the words of John Muir, who once said, \"The mountains are calling and I must go.\" Indeed, living in Flagstaff has made me appreciate the power and majesty of nature in a way that I never had before.\n\nIn addition to its natural beauty, Flagstaff is also home to a vibrant and diverse community. The city has a rich history and a strong sense of identity, which is evident in its numerous cultural events and festivals. One of my favorite experiences in Flagstaff was attending the annual \"First Friday Art Walk,\" where local artists showcase their work in downtown galleries. As I wandered from one gallery to another, I was struck by the creativity and talent of the artists. The vibrant colors and intricate details of their work transported me to another world, where imagination knows no bounds. This experience reminded me of the words of Pablo Picasso, who once said, \"Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.\" Indeed, living in Flagstaff has allowed me to immerse myself in a community that celebrates creativity and expression.\n\nDespite its many charms, living in Flagstaff also comes with its fair share of challenges. One of the most notable challenges is the harsh winter weather. As a first-year student from a warmer climate, I was not prepared for the freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall that Flagstaff experiences. I vividly remember my first encounter with a snowstorm. As I walked to class, the snowflakes fell gently from the sky, creating a winter wonderland.",

This can include teaching the laws of Shabbat, explaining the blessings and prayers, and sharing stories and traditions associated with Shabbat.\n\n2. Shabbat Guides: Create comprehensive guides or pamphlets that provide step-by-step instructions on how to observe Shabbat at home. These guides can include information on lighting Shabbat candles, reciting Kiddush, preparing traditional Shabbat meals, and observing the day of rest.\n\n3. Shabbat Hospitality Program: Establish a program where members of the community can invite others to their homes for Shabbat meals. This will encourage a sense of community and provide opportunities for those who may not have the means or resources to celebrate Shabbat at home.\n\n4. Family-Friendly Activities: Organize family-friendly Shabbat activities in the synagogue, such as Shabbat dinners, storytelling sessions, or game nights. This will create a welcoming environment for families to come together and celebrate Shabbat.\n\n5. Shabbat Prayer Services: Enhance the Shabbat prayer services at the synagogue by incorporating more traditional melodies, engaging sermons, and interactive elements. This will make the services more meaningful and encourage greater participation.\n\n6. Shabbat Study Groups: Establish study groups or learning circles that focus on the teachings and wisdom of Shabbat. These groups can delve into the spiritual and philosophical aspects of Shabbat, providing members with a deeper understanding and appreciation for the observance.\n\n7. Shabbat Retreats: Organize Shabbat retreats or weekends away where members can disconnect from their daily routines and immerse themselves in a Shabbat-focused environment. This will provide an opportunity for individuals to experience a more immersive and spiritual Shabbat celebration.\n\n8. Shabbat Youth Programs: Develop engaging and age-appropriate programs for children and teenagers that emphasize the importance of Shabbat. This can include interactive workshops, games, and discussions about the significance of Shabbat in their lives.\n\n9. Shabbat Community Events: Host community-wide Shabbat events, such as communal meals, Havdalah ceremonies, or outdoor activities. These events will foster a sense of unity and encourage members to come together to celebrate Shabbat.\n\n10. Outreach and Inclusion: Ensure that all members of the community feel welcome and included in Shabbat celebrations.",
        "Submission 2": "Here are some measures and ideas on how the Sophia Jewish community can foster more Shabbat celebration and observance at home and in synagogue:\n\n* **Create a Shabbat planning committee.** This committee could be responsible for planning Shabbat events and activities for both adults and children. They could also work to create a sense of community around Shabbat by organizing potluck dinners, Shabbat walks, and other gatherings.\n* **Offer Shabbat classes and workshops.** These classes could cover topics such as the meaning of Shabbat, how to make Shabbat meals, and how to lead Shabbat services. They would be a great way to educate community members about Shabbat and encourage them to participate more fully in its observance.\n* **Make Shabbat more accessible for families with young children.** This could involve providing childcare during Shabbat services, organizing family-friendly Shabbat activities, and creating Shabbat resources that are tailored to young children.\n* **Encourage people to come to synagogue on Shabbat.** This could involve offering free or discounted Shabbat tickets, providing transportation to and from synagogue, and creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for all.\n* **Make Shabbat more meaningful for individuals.** This could involve helping people to connect with the spiritual aspects of Shabbat, such as prayer, meditation, and reflection. It could also involve encouraging people to take time for rest and relaxation on Shabbat.\n\nBy implementing these measures and ideas, the Sophia Jewish community can make Shabbat a more meaningful and enjoyable experience for everyone.\n\nHere are some additional ideas:\n\n* **Create a Shabbat hotline that people can call for help planning their Shabbat meals or finding childcare.**\n* **Offer Shabbat discounts at local businesses.** This would encourage people to go out and enjoy Shabbat activities in their community.\n* **Partner with other local organizations to host Shabbat events.** This would help to build interfaith relationships and create a sense of community.\n* **Celebrate Shabbat with a festive meal.** This could include traditional Jewish dishes or favorite family recipes.\n* **End the meal with singing and dancing.** This would help to create a sense of joy and celebration.\n* **Take some time to relax and reflect on the week.** This could involve reading, taking a walk, or spending time with loved ones.\n\nBy following these measures and ideas, the Sophia Jewish community can make Shabbat a truly special day for everyone.",

We come together to celebrate the extraordinary life of our dear grandmother, who has left an indelible mark on each and every one of us. As we reflect upon her century-long journey, we are reminded of the immense love, compassion, and strength she possessed.\n\nOur grandmother was a woman of many facets, a true force of nature. Born and raised in the beautiful landscapes of South Dakota, she carried the spirit of the prairies within her soul. Her heart was as vast as the open plains, and her love for her family knew no bounds. She was a pillar of support, a source of wisdom, and a constant presence in our lives.\n\nMarried twice, our grandmother understood the complexities of love and the importance of companionship. She cherished her marriages, embracing the joys and weathering the storms that life brought her way. Through it all, she remained resilient, teaching us the value of commitment and the strength to overcome adversity.\n\nHer nurturing spirit extended beyond her immediate family, as she opened her home to countless foster babies throughout the years. With open arms and boundless love, she provided a safe haven for those in need, giving them a chance at a better future. Our grandmother's selflessness and dedication to these little lives will forever be remembered, and her legacy of compassion will continue to inspire generations to come.\n\nAmong her many passions, our grandmother found solace in the presence of hummingbirds and the beauty they brought to her garden. These delicate creatures symbolize joy, resilience, and the ability to find sweetness in life's smallest moments. Just as she welcomed these tiny birds into her world, she embraced the wonders of life with open arms, finding joy in the simplest of pleasures. Her ability to appreciate the small miracles that surrounded her was a testament to her vibrant spirit and zest for life.\n\nOur grandmother's love for life was also reflected in her love for travel. She had an insatiable curiosity for the world, and her adventures took her to far-flung places, where she immersed herself in different cultures and embraced new experiences. She believed that the world was a classroom, and she was a lifelong student, eager to learn from every corner of the globe.

She was 100 years old, and she had over 30 grandchildren. She was married twice, and she used to foster babies, many of them. She loved hummingbirds and traveling, and she was from South Dakota. She also helped raise me, her first great grandchild.\n\nMy grandmother was a force of nature. She was strong, independent, and fiercely loving. She was always there for me, no matter what. She taught me the importance of family, hard work, and compassion. She was my role model, and I will always be grateful for her.\n\nI have so many fond memories of my grandmother. I remember her baking cookies for me, taking me to the park, and reading me stories. She always had a smile on her face, and she always knew how to make me laugh. She was the most caring and loving person I have ever known.\n\nOne of my favorite memories of my grandmother is when she took me to South Dakota to visit her childhood home. We spent a week exploring the prairies, visiting the Badlands, and hiking in the Black Hills. It was an amazing experience, and I will never forget it.\n\nMy grandmother was also a great foster mother. She took in over 30 babies over the years, and she loved them all like they were her own. She taught them the importance of love, respect, and responsibility. She was a true inspiration to them, and they will never forget her.\n\nMy grandmother was a remarkable woman who lived a long and full life. She was loved by so many people, and she will be deeply missed. I am so grateful for the time I had with her, and I will cherish her memories forever.\n\nThank you.",

        "Submission 1": "Sure, here is a story in a novel format including dialogs between the characters, a story based on the Justice League comics, including the characters, Green Arrow, Red Arrow and Cheshire.\n\nThe Justice League was called to a crime scene in Star City. A high-profile businessman had been found dead, his body riddled with arrows. The League quickly determined that the murder was the work of a professional assassin, and they began to investigate.\n\nGreen Arrow and Red Arrow were assigned to the case. They had a long history with Cheshire, a master assassin who was known to work for both sides of the law. They knew that she was a suspect, but they also knew that she was a master of disguise. It would be difficult to find her.\n\nThe two archers began their investigation by talking to the victim's family and friends. They learned that the victim had been involved in some shady business dealings, and that he had made a lot of enemies. They also learned that he had been seeing a woman named Cheshire.\n\nGreen Arrow and Red Arrow put out an APB on Cheshire, but she was nowhere to be found. They decided to stake out the victim's house, hoping to catch her in the act.\n\nAfter a few days, their patience paid off. Cheshire showed up at the victim's house, disguised as a maid. Green Arrow and Red Arrow followed her, and they eventually tracked her down to an abandoned warehouse.\n\nCheshire was waiting for them inside the warehouse. She had a gun in her hand, and she was ready to fight. Green Arrow and Red Arrow drew their bows, and they prepared for battle.\n\n\"Cheshire,\" said Green Arrow. \"We know you killed him.\"\n\n\"So what?\" said Cheshire. \"He deserved it.\"\n\n\"He was a criminal,\" said Red Arrow. \"But he didn't deserve to die like that.\"\n\n\"He should have thought of that before he crossed me,\" said Cheshire.\n\nThe two archers charged at Cheshire, and she opened fire. Green Arrow and Red Arrow dodged the bullets, and they fired back. The battle was fierce, and neither side was giving an inch.\n\nFinally, Green Arrow got a clear shot. He fired an arrow, and it hit Cheshire in the shoulder. She cried out in pain, and she dropped her gun. Green Arrow and Red Arrow quickly disarmed her, and they took her into custody.\n\nCheshire was brought to justice, and she was sentenced to prison. Green Arrow and Red Arrow were hailed as heroes, and they continued to fight crime as members of the Justice League.\n\n* * *\n\nHere is a sample dialog from the story:\n\n**Green Arrow:** Cheshire, we know you killed him.\n\n**Cheshire:** So what? He deserved it.\n\n**Red Arrow:** He was a criminal, but he didn't deserve to die like that.\n\n**Cheshire:** He should have thought of that before he crossed me.\n\n**Green Arrow:** We're taking you in.\n\n**Cheshire:** You'll never get me alive.\n\n* * *\n\nI hope you enjoyed this story!",

Tonight, however, he sensed something different in the air.\n\nGreen Arrow: (whispering to himself) Something doesn't feel right tonight. I better stay on high alert.\n\nSuddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows, catching Green Arrow off guard. It was none other than his former protege, Red Arrow, also known as Roy Harper.\n\nGreen Arrow: Roy? What are you doing here?\n\nRed Arrow: (smirking) Long time no see, Ollie. Thought I'd pay my old mentor a visit.\n\nGreen Arrow: (narrowing his eyes) What's the real reason you're here, Roy? You disappeared without a trace months ago.\n\nRed Arrow: (sighing) Look, Ollie, I messed up. Big time. I got involved with the wrong people, and... I need your help.\n\nChapter 2: A Dangerous Reunion\n\nGreen Arrow hesitated for a moment, unsure if he could trust his former protege. After all, Roy had betrayed him before. But deep down, he knew that everyone deserved a second chance.\n\nGreen Arrow: Alright, Roy. I'll hear you out. But know this, one wrong move, and I won't hesitate to take you down.\n\nRelieved, Roy began to explain his predicament. He revealed that he had fallen in with a notorious group of criminals led by Cheshire, a deadly assassin.\n\nRed Arrow: Cheshire has been planning something big, Ollie. I don't know all the details, but it involves a dangerous weapon. I want to stop her, but I can't do it alone.\n\nGreen Arrow: (sighing) Alright, Roy. We'll need a plan. We can't just walk into her lair blindly.\n\nChapter 3: Infiltrating the Shadows\n\nGreen Arrow and Red Arrow spent days preparing for their mission. They studied Cheshire's movements, gathering intel on her hideout and her criminal activities. Together, they devised a plan to infiltrate her lair and put an end to her nefarious plans.\n\nAs they arrived at the abandoned warehouse where Cheshire was known to operate, tension filled the air.\n\nGreen Arrow: (whisper",

        "Question": "I'd like you to write me a story in the style of Don Delillo, about a bunch of immortal cats living in a New York high-rise co-op.  Go ahead and start a draft!",
        "Submission 1": "In the heart of Manhattan, where the cityscape stretched out like an endless labyrinth of concrete and glass, there stood a towering co-op building. Its facade, adorned with sleek lines and shimmering windows, seemed to whisper tales of prestige and secrets. Within the walls of this high-rise, a peculiar community thrived, a community that had been dwelling there for as long as anyone could remember. They were the immortal cats.\n\nThese felines, with their piercing eyes and sleek fur, had witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, the evolution of mankind. They had seen empires crumble and wars rage, yet they remained untouched by the passage of time, forever suspended in their feline grace. Their existence was a mystery, an enigma that fascinated the residents of the co-op.\n\nThe residents, a diverse mix of artists, writers, and eccentric souls, had come to accept the presence of these immortal cats as a part of their everyday lives. They had grown accustomed to the cats' silent observations, their aloof demeanor, and their uncanny ability to always be present, no matter the hour.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow upon the city, a meeting was called in the co-op's grand ballroom. The residents gathered, their eyes filled with curiosity and anticipation, as the cats gracefully padded into the room, their tails held high in regal fashion.\n\nAt the head of the gathering was Mr. Whiskers, the elder of the immortal cats. His fur, once vibrant and full, now carried the wisdom of countless centuries. He cleared his throat, and the room fell into a hushed silence.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" Mr. Whiskers began, his voice a low, melodic purr. \"We have gathered here tonight to discuss the future of our coexistence. For too long, we have remained hidden, our immortality a secret known only to a select few. But I propose a change.\"\n\nThe room buzzed with murmurs of intrigue, as the residents leaned forward, their eyes fixed on Mr. Whiskers.\n\n\"We shall reveal ourselves to the world,\" he continued, his eyes gleaming with determination. \"No longer shall we hide in the shadows, confined to this high-rise. It is time for the immortal cats to take their place in the tapestry of New York City.\"\n\nThe residents exchanged glances, their minds racing with the implications of such a revelation. The immortal cats, with their timeless wisdom, had always been a source of inspiration",
        "Submission 2": "In the monolithic heart of New York City, amidst the steel and glass canyons, stood the imposing edifice of the Beaumont Arms Co-op, a fortress of refined living and unspoken secrets. Within its marbled walls, a clandestine society existed, a hidden realm of ageless felines, their existence a silent testament to the city's enduring spirit.\n\nThese cats, the custodians of the Beaumont's hidden history, were not ordinary creatures. They were the immortals, beings of feline grace and timeless wisdom, their lives woven into the very fabric of the building. They had witnessed the rise and fall of empires, the ebb and flow of human passions, their eyes silent observers of the city's ever-changing panorama.\n\nAmong them was Duchess, a sleek Siamese with eyes like pools of jade, her elegance as timeless as the ancient sculptures that graced the Metropolitan Museum. She was the matriarch of the immortal cats, her wisdom and counsel sought by all. Duchess had seen the Beaumont transform from a grand hotel to a haven for the city's elite, her presence a constant in the ever-changing tapestry of residents.\n\nThen there was Oscar, a ginger tabby with a mischievous streak and a penchant for philosophical musings. He was the contrarian, the voice of dissent among the immortal cats, his sharp wit often challenging the status quo. Oscar had witnessed the city's darker side, the rise of crime and the decay of neighborhoods, his observations tinged with a hint of melancholy.\n\nAnd there was Penelope, a tortoiseshell with a heart of gold and a flair for the dramatic. She was the chronicler, the keeper of the immortal cats' collective memory, her tales weaving a rich tapestry of the Beaumont's past. Penelope had witnessed the city's artistic renaissance, the rise of the avant-garde and the explosion of creativity, her stories infused with a touch of bohemian flair.\n\nTogether, these immortal cats formed an invisible community, their lives intertwined with the building's pulse. They roamed the corridors unseen, their footsteps echoing in the silent halls, their presence a subtle reminder of the eternal dance of time. They were the Beaumont's guardians, the keepers of its secrets, their immortality a testament to the enduring spirit of New York City.",

I shall find thee and rescue my daughter, even if it means taking thy life.\n\n**Captor:** Thou art but a feeble old man, past thy prime. I can easily dispatch of thee.\n\n**Bryan Mills:** Underestimate me not, knave! I have honed my skills in the art of warfare, and I shall use them to bring about thy downfall.\n\n**Captor:** Thou art but a fool to threaten me, old man. I have a multitude of men at my command, and they shall not hesitate to silence thee.\n\n**Bryan Mills:** Thy men are but fodder for my fury. I shall cut through them like a scythe through wheat.\n\n**Captor:** Thou art a madman! Thou shalt never reach me!\n\n**Bryan Mills:** I am coming for thee, knave, and there is naught thou canst do to stop me.\n\n**Captor:** We shall see about that, old man! We shall see about that!",

Speak, knaves!\n\nCaptor 1: (chuckles) Good morrow, Mills. Thou art indeed a valiant father, but thy daughters art in our custody. Makest thou no sudden movements, lest harm befall them.\n\nBryan Mills: Fie upon thee, thou miscreants! I shall not rest until my daughters are returned to me unscathed. Pray, tell me, what dost thou desire?\n\nCaptor 2: We seeketh naught but riches, Mills. A hefty ransom shall secure the release of thy precious kin. Deliver unto us a sum of gold, and they shall be set free.\n\nBryan Mills: Nay, I shall not yield to thy demands! I possess a particular set of skills, honed over many years, which shall befall thee should harm come to my daughters. Prepare thyself for retribution!\n\nCaptor 1: (laughs mockingly) Thou art a fool, Mills. Thy threats hold no weight. We art in control, and thou art powerless.\n\nBryan Mills: Thou shalt soon learn the folly of underestimating me, knave. Mark my words, I shall find thee, and when I do, thy punishment shall be severe. Release my daughters now, or face the consequences!\n\nCaptor 2: (pauses, then speaks with a hint of uncertainty) Very well, Mills. We shall consider thy words. But know this, should thou attempt to thwart us, thy daughters shall suffer greatly.\n\nBryan Mills: Thou hast made a grave mistake, villains. I shall not rest until my daughters are safe. Prepare for my wrath, for it shall be swift and merciless!\n\nAnd thus, the conversation betwixt Bryan Mills and his daughters' captors unfolds in the archaic language of Old English, resonating with the fervor and intensity befitting such a momentous exchange.",

        "Submission 1": "The wind howls through the trees, a mournful dirge that echoes the sorrow in my heart. I stand atop the ancient ruins, my gaze sweeping across the desolate landscape, a panorama of shattered dreams.\n\nOnce, this land was a beacon of hope, a realm where magic and wonder intertwined. But now, it lies in ruins, a testament to the folly of man. The towers that once pierced the sky have crumbled to dust, their grandeur reduced to mere rubble. The streets, once teeming with life, are now silent, save for the whispers of the wind and the mournful cries of the damned.\n\nI am the last of my kind, a relic of a bygone era. My kin, the once proud denizens of this land, have vanished, their names lost to the sands of time. I am a solitary figure, adrift in a sea of despair.\n\nLoneliness gnaws at my soul, a relentless parasite that feeds on my memories. I yearn for the laughter of my kin, the warmth of their embrace. But all that remains is the echoing silence, a haunting reminder of what I have lost.\n\nI wander through the ruins, a ghost among the ghosts. My footsteps echo in the empty halls, the only sound in a world that has fallen silent. I touch the weathered stones, tracing the intricate carvings that speak of a forgotten glory.\n\nI am a prisoner of time, trapped in an endless cycle of regret. I relive the past, the moments of joy and sorrow, the triumphs and failures. Each memory is a dagger in my heart, a reminder of what I have lost.\n\nI search for solace in the ruins, a shred of hope to cling to. But there is only darkness, a suffocating void that threatens to consume me. I am adrift in a sea of despair, lost and alone.\n\nI close my eyes, and for a moment, I can almost see the light. I can hear the laughter of my kin, feel the warmth of their embrace. But it is an illusion, a fleeting dream that fades as quickly as it came.\n\nI am alone, forever lost in the ruins of my world.",
        "Submission 2": "(Setting: A dimly lit tavern in the city of Whiterun, Skyrim. The room is filled with the sounds of clinking glasses and hushed conversations. A lone figure sits at a table in the corner, nursing a drink. He is a weathered Nord, with scars etched across his face and a weary expression in his eyes. He raises his glass, his voice filled with a mix of weariness and determination.)\n\nNord: You know, in the end, it's all just a game of survival. A dance with the gods, if you will. We mortals, we're nothing but pawns, caught in the midst of their divine machinations. And yet, we persist. We fight. We claw our way through the chaos, hoping to find some semblance of purpose in this vast, unforgiving world.\n\nI've seen it all, I have. The rise and fall of empires, the birth and death of heroes. I've walked the frozen tundras of Skyrim, battled the beasts of Oblivion, and delved into the depths of ancient ruins. But what is it all for? What drives us to face such peril, such uncertainty?\n\nSome may call it greed, others may say it's power that fuels our desires. But I've come to realize it's something deeper. It's the need to be more than just a pawn, to carve out our own destiny amidst the chaos. To leave a mark, however small, upon this vast tapestry of existence.\n\nWe're not born heroes, you see. We're shaped by the choices we make, the paths we tread. And sometimes, those choices lead us down dark and treacherous roads. We stumble, we fall, but we rise again. It's that resilience, that determination to keep going, that separates us from the rest.\n\nBut it's not just about survival. No, there's something more. Something intangible, yet so powerful. It's the bonds we forge along the way, the friendships, the loves, the losses. They shape us, mold us into something greater than ourselves. They give us purpose, a reason to keep fighting, even when all seems lost.\n\nSo here I sit, in this tavern, nursing my drink and reflecting upon the battles fought and the battles yet to come. The gods may play their games, but I'll be damned if I let them dictate my fate. I'll fight, I'll endure, and I'll leave my mark upon this world, no matter",
