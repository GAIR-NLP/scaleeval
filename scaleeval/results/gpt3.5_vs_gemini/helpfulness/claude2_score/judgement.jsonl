        "Reasoning": " Here is my 150-word evaluation:\n\nBoth submissions are relevant and address the query, but Submission 2 is more comprehensive and insightful. It thoroughly explores how Newton's skills could have advanced biology, providing specific examples of potential breakthroughs in genetics, medicine, ecosystems, etc. Submission 1 also covers relevant impacts but lacks the same level of depth and specificity. Per the criteria, Submission 2 offers valuable context and analysis that substantively enhances understanding, meeting the user's needs for a thoughtful elucidation. In contrast, Submission 1 has more superficial coverage of the peripheral issues. Ultimately, Submission 2 aligns more closely with the \"Highly Helpful\" criteria by providing enriched information beyond the basic question.\n\nTherefore, based on the criteria, Submission 2 is better.\n\n2\n2"
