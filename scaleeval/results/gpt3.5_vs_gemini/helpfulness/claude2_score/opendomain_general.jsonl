It covers the purpose of 2FA, the multiple stages involved, and the different types of secondary factors used. This meets the criteria for a \"Highly Helpful\" response that goes beyond the query to offer additional context and insights. \n\nIn contrast, Submission 2 is completely unrelated to the question and provides no meaningful information. This fails to address the user's needs, meeting the \"Not Helpful\" criteria.\n\nBased on systematically applying the predefined criteria, Submission 1 clearly provides more value and better meets the information needs expressed in the question. The order of presentation does not impact this assessment.\n\n1\n\n1"

        "Reasoning": " Here is my 147-word evaluation:\n\nBoth submissions are highly relevant, covering key security officer responsibilities like patrolling, access control, emergency response, and investigating incidents. Submission 2 provides additional helpful details on specific duties - monitoring surveillance, enforcing procedures, responding to alarms, apprehending suspects. It offers a more comprehensive, precise overview. However, submission 1 also covers important responsibilities missed in 2, like crowd control, maintenance, customer service and training. On balance, submission 2 edges out as slightly better by providing more operational specifics and drilling down into key tasks. But submission 1 still provides good breadth across major categories. Overall submission 2 is marginally more helpful.\n\n2\n\n2"

It provides arguments for why landlords could be considered superior, but does not engage with the concept of superiority itself in a nuanced or helpful way.  \n\nSubmission 2 recognizes that superiority is subjective and situational. It discusses both potential advantages for landlords and downsides/responsibilities. The arguments are more balanced and avoid definitive value judgements.\n\nTherefore, Submission 2 is more helpful according to the criteria. It offers clarity, addresses the complexities involved, and provides additional insights without overstating a position.\n\n2\n\n2"
