It also provides an explicit list of major challenges like radiation, water scarcity, food production, and psychological impact. \n\nSubmission 2 covers similar themes like habitat systems, research, resource management, communication, psychology, and emergency preparedness. While not as rigidly structured, it still addresses the main aspects of the query.\n\nBoth submissions are insightful, relevant and helpful. Submission 1 has a slight edge for its clear organization and direct coverage of challenges. But submission 2 also meets the criteria reasonably well. Overall, neither submission stands out as clearly better.\n\n2\n\n2"

Submission 1 does not directly answer the question asked. Even though Submission 1 provides appropriate names, it does not tell the user which one to actually use. Therefore, Submission 2 better meets the user's needs.\n\n2"
