Both submissions also adhere to the requirements of the problem by checking for the validity of the triangle using the triangle inequality and returning the area rounded to two decimal places or -1 if the triangle is not valid.\n\nHowever, Submission 1 is more detailed and well-articulated, providing a clear explanation of the function's logic, including the use of Heron's formula and the rounding of the area. It also includes comments for clarity, making it more helpful in understanding the implementation.\n\nSubmission 2, while concise, lacks the detailed explanation and clarity provided in Submission 1. It also lacks comments, which may make it less accessible for someone trying to understand the code.\n\nTherefore, based on the criteria, Submission 1 is better.\n\n1"
