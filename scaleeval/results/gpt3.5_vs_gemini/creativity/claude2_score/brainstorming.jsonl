        "Reasoning": " Based on the criteria, Submission 2 is better. It covers more details on the full process of building a PC, from determining needs and budget, choosing compatible components, assembling carefully, installing OS and drivers, to troubleshooting tips. The content flows logically and coherently. Submission 1 provides steps but lacks sufficient details and explanations. The overall quality and completeness of Submission 2 aligns more closely with the \"Proficient\" and \"Mastery\" levels described in the criteria.\n\n2\n\n2"
