It effectively documents any complexities and rationalizes unconventional choices.\n\nBased on the evaluation, the better submission is \"1\"\n\n1"

They both feature a recognizable structure and are supported by a satisfactory quantity of comments and explanations. The variable and function names generally convey their purpose, but there are some areas that are somewhat obscure. Both submissions use the if statement to check the validity of the triangle and calculate the area using the given formula. However, there are no major differences in interpretability between the two submissions.\n\n0"

        "Reasoning": "Based on the criteria provided, both submissions demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem and utilize the Pythagorean theorem to determine if the given sides form a right-angled triangle. Both submissions use appropriate variable names and provide explanations for the logic and approach used.\n\nHowever, Submission 2 is slightly better as it is more concise and presents the solution in a clear and straightforward manner. It uses a well-structured code block and provides a clear explanation of the Pythagorean theorem and how it applies to the problem.\n\nTherefore, the evaluation based on the criteria leads to:\n\n2\n\n"
