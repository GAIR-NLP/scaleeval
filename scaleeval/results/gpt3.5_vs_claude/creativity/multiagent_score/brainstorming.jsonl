        "Question": "How do I detail a car?",
        "Submission 1": " Here are some basic steps for detailing a car:\n\n- Wash - Thoroughly wash the exterior with a car wash soap or shampoo. Use two buckets - one for soapy water and one for rinse water. This prevents dirty rinse water from re-soiling the car.\n\n- Decontaminate - Clay the paint to remove embedded contaminants. Products like tar and fallout remover can help with specific spots. \n\n- Polish - For minor scratches and swirl marks, use a polishing or rubbing compound by hand or with an orbital polisher. Start with a lighter cut and work up to remove imperfections. \n\n- Protect - Apply a quality wax or sealant like carnauba or polymer sealant to add gloss and protection. Ceramic coatings offer even more durable protection.\n\n- Interior - Vacuum upholstery, carpets, and floors. Wipe down dash, doors, and center console. Clean vinyl, plastic, and leather surfaces. Shampoo carpets.\n\n- Glass - Clean all glass inside and out with a glass cleaner or vinegar solution. Polish any etched glass. \n\n- Wheels - Remove wheels if possible for a deeper clean. Otherwise clean around brakes and lug nuts. Use a wheel cleaner or all-purpose solution. \n\n- Tires - Dress tires with a rubber/vinyl dressing to restore black color. \n\n- Final touches - Clean door jambs, rubber seals/trim, and under the hood. Apply interior protectant/dressing as needed.\n\nTaking your time and following the steps will yield the best results. Consider a paint correction for deeper cleaning of oxidation or swirls.",

Physical activity releases endorphins that make you feel good and can help relieve tension and stress. Even a 30-minute walk can help.\n\n- Practice deep breathing. Taking deep breaths helps relax your body and calm your mind. Try breathing in for 5 seconds, holding for 5, and exhaling for 5.\n\n- Get enough sleep. Feeling well-rested helps your body cope with stress. Most adults need 7-9 hours per night. \n\n- Eat a healthy diet. Consuming nutritious, whole foods gives your body and mind fuel to handle stress. Limit caffeine, sugar, and processed foods.\n\n- Spend time in nature. Being outdoors can reset your nervous system and reduce stress and anxiety. Even looking at photos of nature can help. \n\n- Practice meditation or yoga. Activities like meditation, yoga, and tai chi can help calm your mind and relax your body. Many apps offer guided sessions.\n\n- Talk to someone. Sharing your feelings with a friend or making an appointment with a therapist allows you to vent and get an outside perspective. \n\n- Take breaks during the day. Short breaks every 90 minutes or so allow you to recharge. Taking vacations from work can also help manage long-term stress.\n\n- Pick a hobby. Engaging in enjoyable activities you find meaningful, like art, music, cooking, etc. takes your mind off stressors.",

Get enough sleep: Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night to help restore your body and mind.\n\n4. Maintain a healthy lifestyle: Eat a balanced diet, limit caffeine and alcohol intake, and avoid smoking. A healthy body can better handle stress.\n\n5. Prioritize and organize: Create a to-do list, set realistic goals, and break tasks into smaller, manageable steps. This can help you feel more in control and reduce stress.\n\n6. Seek social support: Talk to family, friends, or a therapist about your stressors. Sharing your feelings can provide emotional support and different perspectives.\n\n7. Time management: Learn to manage your time effectively by setting priorities, avoiding procrastination, and delegating tasks when possible.\n\n8. Engage in hobbies and relaxation activities: Engaging in activities you enjoy, such as reading, listening to music, gardening, or pursuing a creative outlet, can help distract your mind from stressors and promote relaxation.\n\n9. Practice self-care: Take time for yourself and engage in activities that promote self-care, such as taking a bath, practicing mindfulness, or engaging in hobbies.\n\n10.

If desired, add the tapioca pearls to the pot and cook until they become transparent and soft. This will take around 10-15 minutes.\n7. Remove from heat and let the Tong Sui cool down a bit. If you prefer it cold, refrigerate for a few hours until chilled.\n8. Before serving, you can add a drizzle of coconut milk on top for extra flavor and creaminess.\n9. Optionally, garnish with some toasted sesame seeds for added texture and presentation.\n10.

        "Submission 1": " Here are some friendly activity and conversation ideas that could help break the ice at meetups:\n\n- Name games - Go around and have everyone share their name and an interesting fact about themselves.\n\n- \"Two truths and a lie\" - People share two truths and one lie about themselves for others to guess which is false.\n\n- Icebreaker questions - Ask fun questions everyone answers briefly like \"What's your dream vacation?\" or \"What's your superpower?\"\n\n- Compliment/sharing circles - Go around and have each person compliment or share something they appreciate about the person before them.  \n\n- Show and tell - Ask people to bring an unusual/small personal item to share the story or meaning behind.\n\n- Discussion questions - Prompt conversations with thought-provoking but not too personal questions like \"What skills have you learned during the pandemic?\"\n\n- Light activity - Like drawing random portraits of each other to break the ice through silly art or a short icebreaker game.\n\n- Local topics - Discuss upcoming events, favorite spots in the area, or current issues to find common ground.\n\n- Getting to know you bingo - Create a bingo board with icebreaker prompts people must find someone who fits each square.\n\nThe key is keeping things positive, lighthearted and inclusive so new connections can start to form organically. Adjusting the pace based on group comfort levels is also helpful.",
        "Submission 2": "Here are some helpful activities or conversation starters to break the ice at meetups:\n\n1. Icebreaker Games: Start the meetup with a fun icebreaker game like \"Two Truths and a Lie\" or \"Would You Rather.\" These games help people get to know each other and create a light-hearted atmosphere.\n\n2. Name Tags: Provide name tags or stickers for attendees to write their names and a fun fact about themselves. This encourages people to approach each other and strike up conversations based on the information shared.\n\n3. Group Activities: Organize group activities that require collaboration or interaction, such as a scavenger hunt or a team-building exercise. This helps people form connections while working together towards a common goal.\n\n4. Speed Networking: Set up a speed networking session where attendees have a limited amount of time to introduce themselves and exchange information. This allows everyone to meet multiple people in a short span of time.\n\n5. Conversation Starters: Prepare a list of interesting conversation starters related to the meetup's theme or common interests. For example, if it's a book club meetup, you could ask, \"What's the best book you've read recently?\" or \"What's your favorite genre?\"\n\n6. Hobby or Interest Sharing: Encourage attendees to bring or talk about something related to their hobbies or interests. This can spark conversations and provide common ground for people to connect over shared passions.\n\n7. Group Discussion: Plan a guided group discussion on a relevant topic. Prepare a few thought-provoking questions to stimulate conversation and encourage attendees to share their thoughts and experiences.\n\n8. Interactive Presentations: Instead of traditional presentations, make them interactive by involving the audience. Incorporate polls, quizzes, or small group discussions within the presentation to engage attendees and encourage participation.\n\nRemember, the key is to create a welcoming and inclusive environment where people feel comfortable initiating conversations and getting to know each other.",

Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer gently for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the chicken is tender and the flavors have melded together.\n\n6. Stir occasionally to prevent the coconut milk from curdling. If the sauce becomes too thick, you can add a little water.\n\n7. Once the chicken is cooked, taste and adjust the seasoning if needed. Remove from heat.\n\n8. Serve the Opor Ayam hot with steamed rice or lontong. You can garnish it with fried shallots or fresh herbs if desired.\n\nEnjoy your homemade Opor Ayam!",

        "Question": "I have my grandfather's antique fountain pen and a bottle of ink, but have never done this before. Can you tell me how to refill the fountain pen?",
        "Submission 1": " Here are the basic steps to refill an antique fountain pen:\n\n1. Unscrew the barrel (the cylindrical part that houses the nib and ink reservoir) from the rest of the pen. \n\n2. Rinse out any remaining ink in the reservoir with clean water to remove residue. You can use a bulb syringe or pipette to help remove the water. \n\n3. Gently blot or air dry the reservoir until it's completely dry. Do not use paper towels as they can snag.\n\n4. Place a few drops of ink (3-5 drops is usually sufficient) directly into the ink reservoir. Do not overfill.\n\n5. Carefully screw the barrel back onto the rest of the pen. Do not over tighten.\n\n6. Draw the plunger up several times to draw the ink down into the feed. This primes the ink flow. \n\n7. Wipe any excess ink off the nib/feed area with a cloth. \n\n8. Your pen should now be ready to write. Test it on a piece of scrap paper. \n\n9. Periodically repeat steps 1-3 to clean and refill as the ink levels run low. Handle the pen gently to avoid leaks.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions! Proper care will help preserve your grandfather's antique pen.",
        "Submission 2": "Certainly! Refilling a fountain pen may seem a bit intimidating at first, but with a little guidance, it can be a straightforward process. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you refill your grandfather's antique fountain pen:\n\n1. Gather your materials: You'll need the fountain pen, a bottle of fountain pen ink, and a clean cloth or tissue.\n\n2. Prepare your workspace: Find a clean and well-lit area to work in. It's a good idea to place a newspaper or paper towel down to catch any potential spills.\n\n3. Unscrew the pen: Most fountain pens have a cap and a barrel. Unscrew the barrel from the grip section or remove any other parts that may be necessary to access the ink reservoir.\n\n4. Check the pen: Before proceeding, inspect the pen to see if there is any ink remaining in the reservoir. If there is, you may need to clean it out first. If it's a new pen or has been recently cleaned, you can skip this step.\n\n5. Dip the nib into the ink: Gently dip the nib (the metal tip of the pen) into the bottle of ink. Submerge it just enough to cover the vent hole, which is usually located on the upper side of the nib.\n\n6. Fill the reservoir: Slowly twist or turn the piston converter (if your pen has one) or press the plunger (if it's a cartridge pen) to draw ink into the reservoir. You can also use a syringe or an eyedropper to fill the converter or ink chamber directly.\n\n7. Remove excess ink: After filling, carefully wipe off any excess ink from the nib and grip section using a clean cloth or tissue. Be cautious not to smudge the ink or get it on your hands.\n\n8. Reassemble the pen: Once you've refilled the pen and cleaned off any excess ink, screw the barrel back onto the grip section or reattach any other parts you removed earlier. Ensure everything is securely fastened.\n\n9. Prime the pen: To get the ink flowing smoothly, gently tap the nib on a clean surface or paper towel. This will help remove any air bubbles and ensure a consistent ink flow.\n\n10. Start writing: Your antique fountain pen is now refilled and ready to use! Give it a few test strokes on a piece of paper to make sure the ink is flowing smoothly before you begin writing.\n\nRemember, each fountain pen may have slight variations in the refilling process, so it's always a good idea to consult",

        "Question": "Can you give any tips on how to cook a juicy, medium-rare steak?",
        "Submission 1": " Here are some tips for cooking a juicy, medium-rare steak:\n\n- Select steaks that are at least 1 inch thick. Thinner steaks can overcook more easily. \n\n- Bring steaks to room temperature before cooking. This prevents the middle from cooling down too quickly when it hits the hot pan or grill.\n\n- Season steaks generously with salt and pepper on both sides. The salt enhances flavor and helps retain moisture.\n\n- Use a very hot cooking surface like a cast iron skillet or grill. This sears the exterior and locks in the juices. \n\n- Cook steaks for 3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare doneness. Use a meat thermometer and aim for an internal temperature of 130-135°F. \n\n- Don't press down on the steaks with a spatula while cooking. This releases precious juices.\n\n- Let steaks rest for at least 5 minutes after cooking. The temperature will continue to rise to 145°F for perfect medium-rare doneness. \n\n- For extra juiciness, consider butter basting the steaks during cooking. You can also use compound butters on top after resting.\n\n- Resist the urge to cut into the steak too early after resting. Give it enough time so the juices don't run out.",
        "Submission 2": "Certainly! Here are some tips to help you cook a juicy, medium-rare steak:\n\n1. Choose the right cut: Look for well-marbled steaks like ribeye, striploin, or tenderloin. Marbling refers to the fat distributed within the muscle, which helps keep the steak moist and flavorful during cooking.\n\n2. Bring the steak to room temperature: Take the steak out of the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes before cooking. This ensures more even cooking.\n\n3. Season properly: Season the steak generously with salt and pepper on both sides just before cooking. You can also add other spices or herbs according to your taste.\n\n4. Preheat your cooking surface: Heat a cast-iron skillet or grill to high heat. A hot surface helps sear the steak and lock in the juices.\n\n5. Sear the steak: Place the steak on the hot surface and let it sear for about 2-3 minutes on each side. This helps develop a nice crust and seals in the juices.\n\n6. Use the touch test: To determine the doneness of the steak, use the touch test. Gently press the center of the steak with your finger. If it feels soft and squishy, it's rare. If it feels slightly firm with a little give, it's medium-rare. Adjust cooking time accordingly.\n\n7. Use a meat thermometer: If you're unsure about the doneness, use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature. For medium-rare, aim for around 130-135°F (55-57°C).\n\n8. Let it rest: After cooking, remove the steak from the heat and let it rest for about 5-10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, resulting in a juicy steak.\n\nRemember, cooking times may vary depending on the thickness of the steak and your preferred level of doneness. Practice and experience will help you perfect your technique over time.",

        "Question": "List pros and cons of lowering the capabilities of my ears by listening to loud music (70-75db) in order to withstand the incredibly loud sound of screaming kids at school.",
        "Submission 1": " I cannot recommend deliberately damaging your hearing. Here are some better alternatives to consider:\n\nCons of listening to loud music:\n\n- Permanent hearing loss. Extended exposure to sounds over 70-75 dB can cause irreversible damage to delicate hearing structures over time. Once lost, hearing cannot be fully restored.\n\n- Tinnitus (ringing in the ears). Loud noise exposure is a common cause of tinnitus, which has no cure. It can be distressing. \n\n- Reduced sound quality. Damaged ears have a harder time distinguishing sounds clearly. You lose out on enjoying music and conversations.\n\n- Health risks. Hearing loss is linked to increased risks of cognitive decline, dementia, depression and social isolation over the long-run.\n\nPros of protecting your hearing: \n\n- Hearing ability lasts a lifetime when cared for. Take steps now to safeguard this precious sense.\n\n- Ask school for noise-reducing headphones during recess if screaming bothers you. Explain your sensitivity without blaming others.\n\n- Talk to a teacher or counselor if kid noise is disruptive or bothersome. They may be able to assist or suggest coping strategies. \n\n- Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing when overwhelmed by loud sounds. Help calm your nervous system.\n\n- Prioritize self-care. Reduce stress in other areas of your life to build resilience against sensory triggers. \n\nDeliberately damaging your hearing is not a wise or healthy long-term solution. Please take care of your ears - you only get one set! Consider alternative coping strategies instead.",
        "Submission 2": "Pros of listening to loud music to withstand loud sounds:\n\n1. Temporary relief: Listening to loud music can provide temporary relief from the noise of screaming kids at school. It may help drown out the noise and make it more bearable.\n\n2. Distraction: Loud music can act as a distraction from the noise, allowing you to focus on something else and potentially reducing the annoyance caused by the screaming kids.\n\n3. Personal enjoyment: If you genuinely enjoy listening to loud music, it can provide you with pleasure and a sense of relaxation or escape from the stressful school environment.\n\nCons of listening to loud music to withstand loud sounds:\n\n1. Hearing damage: Consistently exposing your ears to loud music can lead to permanent hearing damage, such as noise-induced hearing loss or tinnitus. This damage may affect your ability to hear and enjoy music in the long term.\n\n2. Dependency: Relying on loud music to cope with noise may create a dependency, making it difficult for you to tolerate normal noise levels without the use of headphones or loud music.\n\n3. Reduced awareness: Listening to loud music can reduce your awareness of your surroundings, potentially making it harder for you to respond to important sounds or warnings in your environment.\n\n4. Social isolation: If you constantly isolate yourself with loud music, you may miss out on social interactions and opportunities to connect with others, which can have negative effects on your overall well-being.\n\n5. Ineffective coping mechanism: While loud music may provide temporary relief, it does not address the root cause of the problem. It may be more beneficial to explore other coping strategies, such as noise-cancelling headphones, earplugs, or finding quieter spaces.\n\nIt's important to consider the potential long-term consequences of exposing your ears to loud music regularly. If you find the noise at school overwhelming, it may be worth exploring alternative solutions that do not involve compromising your hearing health.",

Letters: The language utilizes the standard Latin alphabet, consisting of 26 letters, both uppercase and lowercase.\n2. Numbers: The language incorporates the digits 0-9 to represent numerical values.\n3. Word Formation: Words in Alphanumerish can be formed by combining letters and numbers in any sequence or arrangement.\n4. Pronunciation: The pronunciation of Alphanumerish words follows the phonetic rules of the English language, with each letter or number representing its respective sound.\n\nExample Words:\n1. IL9op: In Alphanumerish, 'IL9op' could potentially represent a specific concept or object, but without further context, its meaning is unclear.\n2. 3xampl3: This word combines the number '3' with the letters 'x', 'a', 'm', 'p', and 'l' to create a word that could mean 'example' in Alphanumerish.\n\nNote: The above description is a speculative example based on the provided word 'IL9op'.

        "Question": "what are some basics of nutrition that i should be aware of",
        "Submission 1": "Here are some basics of nutrition that you should be aware of:\n\n1. Macronutrients: Your diet should consist of three main macronutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Carbohydrates provide energy, proteins are essential for growth and repair, and fats are important for various bodily functions.\n\n2. Micronutrients: These include vitamins and minerals, which are required in smaller quantities but are still crucial for proper bodily functions. Ensure a balanced intake of vitamins (such as vitamin C, D, and E) and minerals (such as calcium, iron, and potassium).\n\n3. Balanced diet: Aim for a balanced diet that includes a variety of foods from different food groups. This ensures that you get a wide range of nutrients for optimal health.\n\n4. Portion control: Be mindful of portion sizes to avoid overeating. Use smaller plates and bowls to help control your portion sizes.\n\n5. Hydration: Drink an adequate amount of water throughout the day to stay hydrated. Water is essential for digestion, nutrient absorption, and overall bodily functions.\n\n6. Whole foods: Incorporate whole, unprocessed foods into your diet, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. These foods are generally more nutritious and provide a range of essential nutrients.\n\n7. Limit processed foods: Processed foods often contain high levels of unhealthy fats, added sugars, and artificial additives. Limit your intake of processed foods and opt for whole, natural alternatives whenever possible.\n\n8. Fiber: Include fiber-rich foods like whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes in your diet. Fiber aids digestion, promotes satiety, and helps maintain a healthy weight.\n\n9. Limit added sugars: Be mindful of your sugar intake, as excessive consumption of added sugars can lead to weight gain, tooth decay, and other health issues. Check food labels for hidden sugars and choose foods with lower sugar content.\n\n10. Moderation and balance: Practice moderation and balance in your overall eating habits. It's okay to enjoy occasional treats or indulge in your favorite foods, but remember to maintain a balanced diet overall.\n\nRemember, it's always a good idea to consult with a registered dietitian or nutritionist for personalized advice based on your specific needs and goals.",
        "Submission 2": " Here are some basic nutrition concepts to be aware of:\n\n- Macronutrients - Proteins, carbohydrates, and fats are the main sources of calories and important for overall health. Aim for a balanced intake of all three.\n\n- Micronutrients - Vitamins and minerals are essential in small amounts for many bodily functions. Eat a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables to get micronutrients.\n\n- Hydration - Drink water regularly, especially with meals and exercise. Your body needs water for processes like digestion and circulation. \n\n- Calories in vs. calories out - Weight management comes down to balancing the calories you consume with the calories you burn. Be mindful of portion sizes.\n\n- Fiber - Fiber aids digestion and heart health. Find fiber from whole grains, fruits, veggies, legumes. \n\n- Sugar - Limit added sugars and sweets for better health. Too much sugar provides empty calories.\n\n- Fat - Not all fats are equal. Choose unsaturated fats like olive oil over saturated and trans fats when possible. \n\n- Protein - Important for muscles, bones, cells. Meat, eggs, dairy, legumes, nuts offer complete protein. \n\n- Meal timing - Eat regularly spaced meals and snacks to keep your energy and focus steady. \n\n- Nutrient density - Opt for foods like vegetables that provide nutrients but fewer calories.\n\nThose are some basic concepts to keep in mind for a balanced, nutritious diet for health and well-being. Let me know if any areas need more explanation.",

        "Submission 1": "Pros:\n1. Increased flexibility: Remote working allows employees to have more control over their work schedule and location, which can improve work-life balance and increase job satisfaction.\n2. Cost savings: Remote working can reduce costs for both employees and employers. Employees can save on commuting expenses, while employers can save on office space and utilities.\n3. Expanded talent pool: With a remote working policy, employers can hire talent from anywhere in the world, giving them access to a larger pool of qualified candidates.\n4. Increased productivity: Studies have shown that remote workers are often more productive due to fewer distractions and a more comfortable work environment.\n5. Reduced absenteeism: Remote working can help reduce absenteeism due to factors such as bad weather or personal reasons, as employees can still work from home.\n\nCons:\n1. Communication challenges: Remote working can make communication more difficult, especially for teams that heavily rely on in-person collaboration. Misunderstandings and delays in communication can occur.\n2. Lack of social interaction: Remote working can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, as employees may miss out on the social interactions and camaraderie that come with working in an office.\n3. Potential for decreased work-life balance: While remote working can improve work-life balance for some, it can also blur the boundaries between work and personal life, leading to longer work hours and burnout.\n4. Dependence on technology: Remote working relies heavily on technology and a stable internet connection. Technical issues can disrupt work and productivity.\n5. Difficulties in managing and monitoring performance: Managers may find it challenging to monitor and evaluate the performance of remote workers, leading to potential issues with accountability and performance management.",

        "Question": "I am making mayonnaise, it was starting to thicken but now it has become runny and liquid again, is there any way to salvage it?",
        "Submission 1": "Yes, there are a few ways to salvage runny mayonnaise. Here are a few methods you can try:\n\n1. Add an extra egg yolk: In a separate bowl, whisk an additional egg yolk until smooth. Slowly add the runny mayonnaise to the yolk while whisking continuously. This should help emulsify the mixture and thicken it.\n\n2. Mustard or vinegar: Mix a teaspoon of mustard or vinegar into the runny mayonnaise. These ingredients act as emulsifiers and can help stabilize the mixture.\n\n3. Blend with an immersion blender: Transfer the runny mayonnaise to a tall container and use an immersion blender to blend it on a low speed. Gradually increase the speed while blending until the mayonnaise thickens and emulsifies.\n\n4. Slowly add oil: If you have a small amount of runny mayonnaise, you can try slowly adding more oil while whisking vigorously. Start with a few drops at a time and gradually increase the amount until the desired consistency is achieved.\n\nRemember to refrigerate the mayonnaise after salvaging it, as this will help it thicken further.",
        "Submission 2": " Here are a few things you can try to salvage runny mayonnaise:\n\n- Add more yolk - The emulsifying properties of the egg yolks help thicken the mayo. Add another yolk or two and continue to whisk.\n\n- Use an immersion blender - Pour the runny mayo into a container and use an immersion blender to whisk it vigorously. This can help re-emulsify the ingredients.\n\n- Chill it - Sometimes putting the mayo in the fridge for 30 minutes to an hour will allow it to firm up as the oil thickens. Take it out and whisk again before using. \n\n- Add mustard - A teaspoon or two of mustard can help stabilize the emulsion. Whisk it in thoroughly. \n\n- Start over slowly - If it's really broken, you may need to start a new batch, adding the ingredients very slowly. Drizzle oil in while whisking vigorously to emulsify as you go.\n\n- Add cornstarch - As a last resort, you can whisk a teaspoon of cornstarch that's been mixed with a little water into the mayo to help thickening. \n\nWith patience and vigorous whisking, one of these methods often works to get a broken mayo back into emulsion. If all else fails, just consider it a learning experience and start a new batch.",
