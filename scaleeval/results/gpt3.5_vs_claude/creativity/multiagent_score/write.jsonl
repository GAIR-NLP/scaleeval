        "Question": "Create a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nFew-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",

The FewJoint benchmark includes a new corpus with 59 dialogue domains and a code platform to facilitate few-shot experiments. The paper also presents a new method that uses intent information to guide slot filling and introduces a \"trust gating\" mechanism to filter low-confidence intent predictions, improving joint model performance.

Through live seminars, online courses, and one-on-one mentoring, we will teach fathers the importance of their active involvement in their children's lives based on the principles outlined in Dwayne Meeks' bestselling book \"Pieces Never Missing in a Child's Life.\" Our initial target market is churches, schools, and community organizations in major cities across the US where father absenteeism is a significant issue. We believe that by equipping fathers with the tools and insights they need to play an engaged and consistent role, we can help break the cycle of poor fathering and improve outcomes for children.\n\nCompany Overview: \nFather Factor Training was founded by [your name] in [year] with the mission of empowering fathers and promoting healthy child development. Our training programs are based on Dwayne Meeks' framework that outlines 7 core roles every child needs their father to play. Through various educational formats, we help fathers understand how to be providers, protectors, spiritually guiding role models, teachers, disciplinarians, cheerleaders, and more for their children.\n\nMarket Analysis:\nResearch shows that children who grow up without an engaged father figure face much higher risks of dropping out of school, abuse/neglect, incarceration, teen pregnancy, and more.

This translates to a huge market opportunity for Father Factor Training to make a positive social impact. Our programs address a massive need. \n\nServices:\n- Live Seminars: 1-day seminars held on weekends teaching Dwayne Meeks' 7 fathering roles. Includes workshop exercises, group discussions, take-home materials. \n- Online Courses: Self-paced video courses covering each fathering role in more depth.

        "Submission 1": "Living in Flagstaff, Arizona has been an eye-opening experience for me as a first-year college student. The city, nestled in the Coconino National Forest, offers a unique blend of natural beauty and small-town charm. From the moment I arrived, I was captivated by the stunning landscapes, friendly locals, and vibrant community. However, as I settled into my new home, I also noticed some challenges and quirks that make Flagstaff a truly distinct place to live.\n\nOne of the most striking features of Flagstaff is its breathtaking natural surroundings. The city is surrounded by the majestic San Francisco Peaks, which provide a stunning backdrop to everyday life. As I walk to class, I am constantly reminded of the awe-inspiring beauty that surrounds me. The crisp mountain air and the scent of pine trees create a sense of tranquility that is hard to find in other college towns. As I gaze at the snow-capped peaks, I am reminded of the words of John Muir, who once said, \"The mountains are calling and I must go.\" Indeed, living in Flagstaff has made me appreciate the power and majesty of nature in a way that I never had before.\n\nIn addition to its natural beauty, Flagstaff is also home to a vibrant and diverse community. The city has a rich history and a strong sense of identity, which is evident in its numerous cultural events and festivals. One of my favorite experiences in Flagstaff was attending the annual \"First Friday Art Walk,\" where local artists showcase their work in downtown galleries. As I wandered from one gallery to another, I was struck by the creativity and talent of the artists. The vibrant colors and intricate details of their work transported me to another world, where imagination knows no bounds. This experience reminded me of the words of Pablo Picasso, who once said, \"Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.\" Indeed, living in Flagstaff has allowed me to immerse myself in a community that celebrates creativity and expression.\n\nDespite its many charms, living in Flagstaff also comes with its fair share of challenges. One of the most notable challenges is the harsh winter weather. As a first-year student from a warmer climate, I was not prepared for the freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall that Flagstaff experiences. I vividly remember my first encounter with a snowstorm. As I walked to class, the snowflakes fell gently from the sky, creating a winter wonderland.",
        "Submission 2": " Here is a draft 1221-word two-topic essay as a first-year college student including personal experiences and observations of Flagstaff, Arizona and Kaneohe, Hawaii along with four in-text citations and a works cited in MLA style:\n\nTransitioning to College Life in Flagstaff and Hawaii \n\nAs a recent high school graduate, moving away from home to begin my college career was an exciting yet nerve-wracking change. I chose to attend Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona for the first year before studying abroad in Hawaii my sophomore year. Both locations offered me unique experiences and observations as I adjusted to independent living. \n\nFlagstaff offered mountain scenery and four distinct seasons, quite a change from the hot desert climate of my hometown in Arizona. The elevation of 7,000 feet meant cooler temperatures even in the summer and occasional snowfall in the winter. My roommate and I woke up one morning our first semester to a fresh layer of powder covering the pine trees and lawns of our dorm complex. As Pete Seeger observes, \"Snow falls ubiquitously in winter, each flake as it sifts earthward, a miracle\" (Seeger). Seeing the snow enhance the beauty of the peaks surrounding Flagstaff was truly a sight to behold and introduced me to seasons I had never experienced before.  \n\nAnother notable aspect of Flagstaff was its large student population relative to the size of the town. With Northern Arizona University's main campus located right in the heart of downtown, it seemed like every other person I passed on the streets or in stores was also a college student. This meant plenty of campus events and activities to get involved in to meet new people. However, it could also get crowded on game days when tens of thousands of fans descended on the city. As one resident noted, “On football Saturdays downtown is utter mayhem as green and gold clad fans spill out of the bars” (Johnson 25). Finding a parking spot or getting a table at a restaurant during these times required strategic planning and patience. \n\nAnother major difference between Flagstaff and my hometown was the thriving outdoor recreation scene. Being surrounded by towering ponderosa pines and just a short drive from beautiful Red Rock trails or slickrock rock climbing made it easy to enjoy activities like hiking, biking, and rock climbing on weekends or after class. The abundance of public lands so close to campus was truly unique.",

        "Submission 1": "Ladies and gentlemen,\n\nToday, we gather here to bid farewell to a remarkable woman, a guiding light in our lives, and a beloved matriarch of our family. We come together to celebrate the extraordinary life of our dear grandmother, who has left an indelible mark on each and every one of us. As we reflect upon her century-long journey, we are reminded of the immense love, compassion, and strength she possessed.\n\nOur grandmother was a woman of many facets, a true force of nature. Born and raised in the beautiful landscapes of South Dakota, she carried the spirit of the prairies within her soul. Her heart was as vast as the open plains, and her love for her family knew no bounds. She was a pillar of support, a source of wisdom, and a constant presence in our lives.\n\nMarried twice, our grandmother understood the complexities of love and the importance of companionship. She cherished her marriages, embracing the joys and weathering the storms that life brought her way. Through it all, she remained resilient, teaching us the value of commitment and the strength to overcome adversity.\n\nHer nurturing spirit extended beyond her immediate family, as she opened her home to countless foster babies throughout the years. With open arms and boundless love, she provided a safe haven for those in need, giving them a chance at a better future. Our grandmother's selflessness and dedication to these little lives will forever be remembered, and her legacy of compassion will continue to inspire generations to come.\n\nAmong her many passions, our grandmother found solace in the presence of hummingbirds and the beauty they brought to her garden. These delicate creatures symbolize joy, resilience, and the ability to find sweetness in life's smallest moments. Just as she welcomed these tiny birds into her world, she embraced the wonders of life with open arms, finding joy in the simplest of pleasures. Her ability to appreciate the small miracles that surrounded her was a testament to her vibrant spirit and zest for life.\n\nOur grandmother's love for life was also reflected in her love for travel. She had an insatiable curiosity for the world, and her adventures took her to far-flung places, where she immersed herself in different cultures and embraced new experiences. She believed that the world was a classroom, and she was a lifelong student, eager to learn from every corner of the globe. Her stories and memories will forever be etched in our hearts, inspiring us to explore, to seek, and to never stop learning.",
        "Submission 2": " Here is a draft eulogy for your beloved 100-year-old grandmother:\n\nWe gather here today to celebrate the remarkable life of Mary Smith. At 100 years of age, Grandma Mary packed more living into her lifetime than most. She was a wife, mother, homesteader, foster mother, and friend to so many. \n\nGrandma Mary was born and raised in South Dakota. She met her first husband John on the windswept prairies and they started their family together. Through the ups and downs of life on the farm, their love endured and they had 6 children of their own. Even after John passed, Grandma Mary kept her home open and her heart open wider. She fostered over 30 babies and children through the decades, giving them love and care when they needed it most. \n\nAfter losing her dear John, Grandma Mary found love again with Thomas. They enjoyed travels across the country in their retirement, always seeking new sights and hummingbirds to spot. Grandma Mary had a soft spot for the tiny hummingbirds that would flock to her feeders. Wherever she went, her own flock grew - with children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and beyond, she amassed over 30 grandchildren who all knew her kindness.\n\nI feel so blessed that Grandma Mary was a part of my childhood. As her first great-grandbaby, she helped raise me with all the love, care, and wisdom of someone far wiser than their years. She showed me the importance of family, faith, hard work and enjoying life's simple pleasures. I'll never forget her smile, her hugs, or her habit of always having something baked for whoever stopped by. \n\nAt 100 years old, Grandma Mary lived a full life that spanned eras on the prairie and touched so many lives. While we'll miss her dearly, her legacy of love, strength and compassion will live on in all of our hearts. Thank you for being our guiding light, Grandma. May you now find joy and peace eternal with those who have gone before. You will always be with us.",

As Team Leader of the Justice League, it was his responsibility to ensure peace and justice prevailed, even on nights like this.\n\nSuddenly, his keen ears picked up the sounds of a scuffle emanating from a darkened alleyway between two run-down warehouses. Pulling an arrow from his quiver, he stealthily made his way to the edge of the roof and peered down into the gloom. \n\nThrough the torrential rain, he spotted two figures grappling in hand to hand combat. One was clad head to toe in black leather, a cat-like mask obscuring their face. The other wore familiar red body armour with an arrow emblem emblazoned on the chest.\n\n\"Well, well, looks like my former apprentice has gotten himself into a spot of trouble,\" Green Arrow murmured to himself with a wry smile. \n\nWithout hesitation, he jumped from the rooftop, firing a line arrow that caught on a nearby fire escape. He slide down the cord with practised ease and landed soundlessly behind the combatants.\n\n\"I'd say you two crazy kids should take your fight somewhere more appropriate. How about the living room? I'll make popcorn,\" Green Arrow quipped, nocking another arrow to cover the duo.\n\nThe leather-clad fighter spun around, twin sai knives glinting menacingly in the darkness. Even with her face hidden, Green Arrow recognised the curves of her physique.\n\n\"Cheshire,\" he growled. \"I should have known you'd be behind this.\"\n\n\"My, my, always the charmer aren't we Ollie?\" she cooed, voice distorted by the cat mask. \"I was just having a little chat with your ginger sidekick here.\"\n\nRed Arrow straightened up, rubbing his bruised jaw. \"More like she was trying to shank me for getting too close to one of her operations downtown.

The tower loomed 50 stories, an edifice of concrete and glass that confined their eternal spans. None could recall how long they had resided here, only that it had always been, would always be. \n\nMittens paused before entering, considering the particles of dust suspended in the angled sunrise. Time meant nothing, and yet marked their days precisely as the sun rose and fell. Within, the others waited - Fluffy, Chairman Meow, Mr. Bigglesworth. A life suspended in repetition, ritual, yet each dawn held mystery for minds that stretched back to sensations none but they remembered. \n\nChairman sat by the window, watching clouds scud past. He thought of the pigeons that roosted below, living and dying as birds do while he remained. What did they see when they glimpsed in through the wall of glass? Cats motionless as statues, eyes that held the depthlessknowledge of eternity. Their song scattered on the wind, unintelligible yet speaking of things beyond avian ken. \n\nThe sound of claws on tile signaled Mittens' arrival. She padded to her place, circling thrice before settling. Their eyes met, and in that moment centuries of unspoken communion passed. Beyond the plate glass, New York glittered with its ceaseless stimulation, its churning torrent of lives flashing by in flickers. But here reigned an endless quiet, an oasis amid the roar.\n\nHow's that? I tried to capture Delillo's attention to small ritual details, hints of larger philosophical themes, and a sense of timelessness among transient modern structures. Let me know if you'd like me to continue or modify the draft in any way.",
        "Submission 2": "In the heart of Manhattan, where the cityscape stretched out like an endless labyrinth of concrete and glass, there stood a towering co-op building. Its facade, adorned with sleek lines and shimmering windows, seemed to whisper tales of prestige and secrets. Within the walls of this high-rise, a peculiar community thrived, a community that had been dwelling there for as long as anyone could remember. They were the immortal cats.\n\nThese felines, with their piercing eyes and sleek fur, had witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, the evolution of mankind. They had seen empires crumble and wars rage, yet they remained untouched by the passage of time, forever suspended in their feline grace. Their existence was a mystery, an enigma that fascinated the residents of the co-op.\n\nThe residents, a diverse mix of artists, writers, and eccentric souls, had come to accept the presence of these immortal cats as a part of their everyday lives. They had grown accustomed to the cats' silent observations, their aloof demeanor, and their uncanny ability to always be present, no matter the hour.\n\nOne evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow upon the city, a meeting was called in the co-op's grand ballroom. The residents gathered, their eyes filled with curiosity and anticipation, as the cats gracefully padded into the room, their tails held high in regal fashion.\n\nAt the head of the gathering was Mr. Whiskers, the elder of the immortal cats. His fur, once vibrant and full, now carried the wisdom of countless centuries. He cleared his throat, and the room fell into a hushed silence.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" Mr. Whiskers began, his voice a low, melodic purr. \"We have gathered here tonight to discuss the future of our coexistence. For too long, we have remained hidden, our immortality a secret known only to a select few. But I propose a change.\"\n\nThe room buzzed with murmurs of intrigue, as the residents leaned forward, their eyes fixed on Mr. Whiskers.\n\n\"We shall reveal ourselves to the world,\" he continued, his eyes gleaming with determination. \"No longer shall we hide in the shadows, confined to this high-rise. It is time for the immortal cats to take their place in the tapestry of New York City.\"\n\nThe residents exchanged glances, their minds racing with the implications of such a revelation. The immortal cats, with their timeless wisdom, had always been a source of inspiration",

Lo, allow me to present unto thee a revised rendition in the ancient tongue of Old English:\n\nBryan Mills: Hark! I beseech thee, who hath taken my daughters? Speak, knaves!\n\nCaptor 1: (chuckles) Good morrow, Mills. Thou art indeed a valiant father, but thy daughters art in our custody. Makest thou no sudden movements, lest harm befall them.\n\nBryan Mills: Fie upon thee, thou miscreants! I shall not rest until my daughters are returned to me unscathed. Pray, tell me, what dost thou desire?\n\nCaptor 2: We seeketh naught but riches, Mills. A hefty ransom shall secure the release of thy precious kin. Deliver unto us a sum of gold, and they shall be set free.\n\nBryan Mills: Nay, I shall not yield to thy demands! I possess a particular set of skills, honed over many years, which shall befall thee should harm come to my daughters. Prepare thyself for retribution!\n\nCaptor 1: (laughs mockingly) Thou art a fool, Mills. Thy threats hold no weight. We art in control, and thou art powerless.\n\nBryan Mills: Thou shalt soon learn the folly of underestimating me, knave. Mark my words, I shall find thee, and when I do, thy punishment shall be severe. Release my daughters now, or face the consequences!\n\nCaptor 2: (pauses, then speaks with a hint of uncertainty) Very well, Mills. We shall consider thy words. But know this, should thou attempt to thwart us, thy daughters shall suffer greatly.\n\nBryan Mills: Thou hast made a grave mistake, villains. I shall not rest until my daughters are safe. Prepare for my wrath, for it shall be swift and merciless!\n\nAnd thus, the conversation betwixt Bryan Mills and his daughters' captors unfolds in the archaic language of Old English, resonating with the fervor and intensity befitting such a momentous exchange.",

        "Submission 1": "(Setting: A dimly lit tavern in the city of Whiterun, Skyrim. The room is filled with the sounds of clinking glasses and hushed conversations. A lone figure sits at a table in the corner, nursing a drink. He is a weathered Nord, with scars etched across his face and a weary expression in his eyes. He raises his glass, his voice filled with a mix of weariness and determination.)\n\nNord: You know, in the end, it's all just a game of survival. A dance with the gods, if you will. We mortals, we're nothing but pawns, caught in the midst of their divine machinations. And yet, we persist. We fight. We claw our way through the chaos, hoping to find some semblance of purpose in this vast, unforgiving world.\n\nI've seen it all, I have. The rise and fall of empires, the birth and death of heroes. I've walked the frozen tundras of Skyrim, battled the beasts of Oblivion, and delved into the depths of ancient ruins. But what is it all for? What drives us to face such peril, such uncertainty?\n\nSome may call it greed, others may say it's power that fuels our desires. But I've come to realize it's something deeper. It's the need to be more than just a pawn, to carve out our own destiny amidst the chaos. To leave a mark, however small, upon this vast tapestry of existence.\n\nWe're not born heroes, you see. We're shaped by the choices we make, the paths we tread. And sometimes, those choices lead us down dark and treacherous roads. We stumble, we fall, but we rise again. It's that resilience, that determination to keep going, that separates us from the rest.\n\nBut it's not just about survival. No, there's something more. Something intangible, yet so powerful. It's the bonds we forge along the way, the friendships, the loves, the losses. They shape us, mold us into something greater than ourselves. They give us purpose, a reason to keep fighting, even when all seems lost.\n\nSo here I sit, in this tavern, nursing my drink and reflecting upon the battles fought and the battles yet to come. The gods may play their games, but I'll be damned if I let them dictate my fate. I'll fight, I'll endure, and I'll leave my mark upon this world, no matter",

Our goal is to bring transparency, accessibility, and community to the hedge fund industry through decentralization.\n\nTraditional hedge funds suffer from issues of opacity, high fees, and the need for large minimum investments that exclude most investors. Kunji aims to solve these problems by operating as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) on the blockchain. \n\nOur Innovation\n\nSome key innovations that Kunji brings include:\n\n- Transparency: All fund holdings, trades, and financials will be viewable on the blockchain for full transparency. \n\n- Democratic Governance: Fund members can vote on investment decisions, manager selections, and other governance decisions through on-chain voting. \n\n- Lower Fees: By removing middlemen, Kunji offers lower annual management and performance fees than traditional funds. \n\n- Accessibility: Anyone can invest as little as 0.1 ETH instead of millions required by many hedge funds. \n\n- Community-Powered: Members work together through social features to share insights, investment ideas, and grow the fund collectively.\n\nTechnology\n\nKunji is built on the Ethereum blockchain for security, transparency and smart contract programmability. Our DAO will run on a smart contract that automates fund administration, tracks investments, calculates profits/losses, and executes payouts. \n\nAn ERC-20 compatible token, called KUNJI, will represent fund units. Members lock their ETH in the smart contract in exchange for KUNJI tokens. All trading and investment decisions are executed on-chain. \n\nInvestment Strategy\n\nKunji will employ a long/short equity strategy, targeting annual returns of 8-12% with lower volatility than the market. We analyze macroeconomic indicators, sector rotations, and individual stocks/bonds to identify undervalued and overvalued assets. \n\nOur in-house quantitative models combine fundamentals and technical analysis to generate trading signals. Manual research supplements automated strategies. Profits are hedged through diversification and derivatives to reduce risk.\n\nRoadmap\n\nIn Phase 1, we will launch our minimum viable product - the Kunji DAO and smart contract platform. In Phase 2, we aim to on-board 10,000+ members and deploy $5M in assets under management. \n\nPhase 3 involves expanding our offerings",

Submission 2, while creative and personal, exceeds the character limit, which is a practical constraint that cannot be overlooked.\n\nAfter considering the other speakers' perspectives, my view remains unchanged. The Twitter bio's purpose is to convey essential information within a strict character limit. Submission 1 achieves this while still being creative and maintaining a casual tone. Submission 2, despite its appealing content, fails to meet the fundamental requirement of brevity for a Twitter bio.\n\n1\n\n1",

However, I still believe Submission 1 is the better choice because it concisely covers the key points in an appropriately casual tone without exceeding the character limit, showing mastery of the Twitter bio format. While Submission 2 has creative details, they distract from the main focus and don't align with the practical need for brevity. Given the criteria emphasizing creativity, coherence, and brevity, I stand by my original choice. Adhering to the character limit while remaining focused and casual is most important for a Twitter bio.\n\n1\n\n1",

Both Speaker 1 and Speaker 2 recognize the merits of each submission, with Speaker 1 favoring the brevity and focus of Submission 1 and Speaker 2 appreciating the personal touch and inviting nature of Submission 2.\n\nUpon reviewing the evaluations and discussions, I still believe that Submission 1 is the superior choice. It effectively communicates the main points within the character limit, demonstrating creativity and a casual tone. While Speaker 2 makes a compelling argument for the personal tone of Submission 2, the character limit is a critical aspect of Twitter bios that cannot be dismissed. Submission 2 exceeds the limit, which could lead to practical issues if used in an actual Twitter bio.\n\nConsidering the criteria and the perspectives of the other speakers, my stance remains unchanged. The ability to convey essential information succinctly is paramount for a Twitter bio, and Submission 1 achieves this while also being creative and casual. Therefore, I maintain my original choice.\n\n1\n\n1",
