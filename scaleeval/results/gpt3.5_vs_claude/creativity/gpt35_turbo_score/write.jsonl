However, there are areas in both submissions that could be further enriched through deeper exploration and more coherent structure. While both submissions successfully mock the financial struggles of a college student in Silicon Valley, they lack depth and originality in their jokes. The humor is somewhat generic and lacks a profound level of creativity.\n\nGiven this evaluation, I would choose \"Neither is better: 0\" as neither submission fully meets the criteria for a proficient or mastery level response."
