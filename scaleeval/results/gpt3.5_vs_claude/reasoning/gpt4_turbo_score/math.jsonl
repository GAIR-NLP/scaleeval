It aligns well with the 'Proficient' level (4) on the criteria scale.\n\nSubmission 2, however, makes a rounding error by rounding down 3965421.5 to 3965421 instead of rounding to the nearest whole number, which should be 3965422. This leads to an incorrect total of 19877119 M&Ms. This submission exhibits an understanding of the relevant principles but is marred by a significant computational error. It aligns with the 'Developing' level (2) on the criteria scale.\n\nAccording to the criteria and the error made in Submission 2, Submission 1 is better.\n\n1\n\n1"

        "Reasoning": "Evaluating the submissions involves checking for mathematical accuracy, clarity, and adherence to the problem's requirements. Both submissions begin by calculating the total number of bananas bought in bunches, which is correct. However, the average number of bananas per bunch (8241786) is clearly a typographical or conceptual error, as it's not feasible for a bunch to contain millions of bananas. Both submissions fail to recognize this error, leading to an unrealistic calculation of total cost savings.\n\nSubmission 1 calculates the total cost of buying individually as $65,934,280 and the bunch cost as $30, resulting in savings of $65,934,250. Submission 2 calculates the total individual cost as $65,934,288 and the bunch cost as $30, resulting in savings of $65,934,258.\n\nBoth submissions have the same logical structure and minor differences in the final dollar amount due to rounding discrepancies. Neither submission identifies the implausible number of bananas per bunch, which is a critical oversight.\n\nGiven the similarity in approach and the shared oversight of the unrealistic banana count, neither submission is better than the other.\n\n0\n\n0"
