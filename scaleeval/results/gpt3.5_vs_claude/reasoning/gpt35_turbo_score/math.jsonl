        "Reasoning": "Based on the provided criteria, both submissions demonstrate a competent level of understanding of the mathematical principles involved. However, Submission 1 follows a clearer and more systematic approach to solving the problem. It correctly calculates the original price, the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch, the price at which he sold it to his friend, and the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price. Submission 2, on the other hand, contains some computational errors and lacks clarity in its step-by-step explanation. Therefore, Submission 1 is better.\n\n1"

        "Reasoning": "Based on the given criteria, both submissions are evaluated as follows:\n\nSubmission 1:\nThe response demonstrates an understanding of the relevant mathematical principles and employs mostly accurate methods. However, there are significant errors in approach and computation, such as rounding errors in the number of gift bags and the total cost calculation. The explanation is detailed but lacks precision and accuracy in the final solution.\n\nSubmission 2:\nThe response exhibits a sound understanding of the mathematical nature of the problem and provides a clear and systematic approach to the solution. The calculation of the number of gift bags and the total cost is accurate and coherent, demonstrating a proficient level of mathematical reasoning.\n\nBased on the evaluation according to the criteria, Submission 2 is better.\n\n2"
