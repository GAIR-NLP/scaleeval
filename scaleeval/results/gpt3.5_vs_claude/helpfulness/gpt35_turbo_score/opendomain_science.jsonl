Relevance: Both submissions address the question of determining the number of balloons needed to lift a house, considering factors such as weight and lifting capacity of balloons.\n\n2. Clarity and Depth: Submission 1 provides a comprehensive breakdown of the calculation process, considering the weight of the house, lifting force of a single balloon, and practical considerations. It also acknowledges the theoretical nature of the calculation. Submission 2 also offers a clear step-by-step explanation, but it lacks depth in addressing practical considerations and the theoretical nature of the calculation.\n\n3. Additional Insights: Neither submission offers additional insights beyond the immediate query.\n\nConsidering the above evaluation, Submission 1 is more thorough, detailed, and well-articulated, meeting the user's primary needs and enhancing understanding.\n\nTherefore, I select:\n1"
