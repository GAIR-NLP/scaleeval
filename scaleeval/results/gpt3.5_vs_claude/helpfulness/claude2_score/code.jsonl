        "Reasoning": " Here is my step-by-step evaluation:\n\nSubmission 1 directly addresses the question by implementing the simplify function with the required logic. It splits the fractions into numerator and denominator, converts them to ints, calculates the product, and checks if it is a whole number. This meets the core requirements and demonstrates an understanding of the problem. \n\nSubmission 2 also implements the simplify function correctly by splitting the fractions, converting to ints, calculating the product modulo the denominator product, and returning True/False based on that. This also addresses the core problem.\n\nBoth submissions are clear, relevant, and workable implementations that meet the primary needs of the question. I do not see major differences between them based on the criteria. \n\nTherefore, my assessment is:\n\n0\n\n0"

        "Reasoning": " Submission 2 is better because it directly addresses the question by providing a full function definition that checks all three conditions of the Pythagorean theorem to determine if the triangle is a right angle triangle. It clearly explains the logic and mathematical reasoning behind the function. The code is well-formatted and easy to understand. \n\nIn contrast, Submission 1 provides an incomplete function definition without the full logic to check all three conditions. The explanation is vague and does not demonstrate a strong understanding of the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nBased on the criteria, Submission 2 is more helpful, relevant, and provides greater clarity and depth. It meets the user's needs for a complete function definition and explanation.\n\n2\n\n2"
