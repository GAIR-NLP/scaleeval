The calculations are shown and explained in detail. Submission 1 provides the same information but does not show the step-by-step work. Based on the criteria requiring a detailed, well-articulated response, Submission 2 is better as it shows the full methodology. \n\n2\n\n2"

        "Reasoning": " Here is my evaluation reasoning in under 150 words:\n\nSubmission 1 shows step-by-step work and calculations to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price. It demonstrates an understanding of the multi-step percentage and arithmetic calculations required to solve this word problem. Submission 2 also shows work and calculations, but has some minor errors in the percentages that yield an incorrect final percentage discount. Based on the criteria requiring a response to be detailed, well-articulated, and offer valuable information without errors, Submission 1 is better.\n\n2\n\n2"

It demonstrates understanding of the key steps - finding the number of attendees, calculating the number of gift bags needed, and multiplying by the cost per bag. \n\nSubmission 2 also shows the calculations, though in a more condensed format. It correctly identifies the key steps and data points needed. Both submissions arrive at the same final cost amount.\n\nWhile Submission 1 shows more work, Submission 2 is more concise. Both adequately address the question and meet the criteria. Since there is no significant difference in the quality, I rate them as equal.\n\n2"
