        "Reasoning": " Here is my evaluation reasoning in under 150 words:\n\nSubmission 1 provides a clear, step-by-step walkthrough of the PC building process, covering all major components and installation steps in the proper order. It offers specifics and details on compatibility, cable management, testing, and OS installation. Submission 2 also covers main steps but lacks the same level of detail and misses some key steps like testing outside the case. Submission 1 is more comprehensive and provides valuable specifics that a beginner would need when building a PC. \n\nBased on the criteria, Submission 1 rates higher in being helpful, thorough, precise, and providing enriched context and supplementary information. Submission 2 is more superficial in comparison.\n\nTherefore, my evaluation is that Submission 1 is better.\n\n1"
