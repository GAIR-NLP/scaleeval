        "Reasoning": " Here is my 150 word evaluation:\n\nSubmission 1 takes a more enthusiastic tone, using exclamations and emojis to garner excitement. However, it lacks specifics on the actual project and its goals. Submission 2 clearly states the goal of the project, expected benefits, and persuasive reasons for contributing. While less flashy, it provides more substantive information. Based on the criteria focusing on relevance, details, and meeting the user's needs, Submission 2 is more direct and informative. It explains what the project hopes to accomplish and why participation matters. The enthusiastic tone of Submission 1 is appealing but lacks the concrete details that would actually persuade involvement. Therefore, strictly following the outlined criteria, Submission 2 is better.\n\n2"

While both have a casual tone, Submission 2 is more comprehensive. \n\nBased on the criteria, Submission 2 is more helpful as it directly addresses the user's needs and provides the requested details. Submission 1 lacks some key points, leaving the user's requirements partially unmet. \n\nTherefore, Submission 2 is better according to the outlined criteria.\n\n2\n\n2"
