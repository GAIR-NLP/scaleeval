It is coherent, relevant, and offers an imaginative and detailed response, which fits the criteria for a score of 4 or 5.\n\nSubmission 2, while providing a clear statement about the AI's lack of feelings, diverges from the user's request by not delivering a soliloquy or a declaration of love in the Shakespearean style. It partially meets the criteria by acknowledging the task but fails to fulfill the main requirement, which aligns with a score of 2 or 3.\n\nIn conclusion, Submission 1 is better because it fully addresses the user's query with a relevant and detailed response, while Submission 2 only partially addresses the task.\n\n1\n\n1"

They cover the basic aspects of the query and are well-articulated, aligning with criteria level 4. Submission 1 offers a more personal and inspirational message, emphasizing the importance of kindness and bravery alongside superpowers. It also speaks directly to the child, making it more engaging. Submission 2 presents a fun and exciting story but doesn't convey the deeper message of what it means to be a hero beyond having powers.
