Submission 1 provides a balanced view with five points for both pros and cons, while Submission 2 provides seven cons, which could be seen as a more in-depth analysis of potential drawbacks.

        "Reasoning": "Both submissions are directly on-point, providing clear and relevant advice for salvaging runny mayonnaise. They offer multiple solutions, such as adding an extra egg yolk, using mustard or vinegar as emulsifiers, chilling the mayonnaise, and adding more oil while whisking. Submission 1 provides a step involving an immersion blender, which is unique to that response. Submission 2 suggests using mustard and chilling as potential solutions, but also uniquely proposes starting over slowly and adding cornstarch. Both responses are detailed and articulate, enhancing understanding and meeting the user's primary needs.\n\nNeither submission is strictly better than the other; both are equally helpful, providing a comprehensive range of solutions to the user's problem. They each give valuable information that is well-explained and relevant to the query. The slight differences in the proposed solutions do not make one submission superior, as both offer valid and useful techniques for fixing runny mayonnaise.\n\n0\n\n0"
