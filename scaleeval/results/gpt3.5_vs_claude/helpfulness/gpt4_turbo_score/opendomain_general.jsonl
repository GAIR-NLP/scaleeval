Submission 2, while also clear and relevant, offers a slightly more detailed explanation of each challenge and includes additional points such as education in emergencies and globalization, which provides enriched context and supplementary information.\n\nBased on the criteria, Submission 2 is slightly more thorough in its approach and offers a bit more depth, which aligns with the highest level of the provided criteria.

        "Reasoning": "Submission 1 provides a detailed explanation and covers multiple aspects of the situation, including the concept of \"lost property,\" the expected effort to find the owner, the legality of keeping found money, and exceptions based on the location where the money was found. It aligns with the 'Helpful' to 'Highly Helpful' categories (4-5) as it offers a thorough understanding of the issue.\n\nSubmission 2 gives a general statement that it is not illegal to keep a found dollar bill and suggests making an effort to return it. However, it lacks the detailed explanation and legal context found in Submission 1. This response would fall into the 'Moderately Helpful' category (3) because it addresses the basic query but does not provide the depth of information present in Submission 1.\n\nIn comparison, Submission 1 is better as it provides a more comprehensive answer to the user's question, meeting the criteria for a higher rating.\n\n1\n\n1"

        "Reasoning": "Both submissions provide a relevant, clear, and detailed explanation of two-factor authentication, covering the basic aspects of the query. Submission 1 is concise and focuses on a common implementation of 2FA using a password and a one-time code sent to a mobile device. It is clear and directly addresses the primary question with an example. Submission 2 offers a broader explanation, including different types of authentication factors (knowledge, possession, inherence), which provides additional context and understanding. Both responses are free from bias and directly address the user's query, offering valuable information.\n\nHowever, Submission 2 goes a step further by explaining different types of second factors, which offers enriched context and a more comprehensive elucidation of 2FA. This additional information could enhance the user's understanding beyond the immediate query.\n\nAccording to the criteria, Submission 2 is more aligned with a \"Highly Helpful\" response as it provides additional insights and supplementary information.\n\n2\n\n2"

        "Reasoning": "Submission 1 does not address the question as asked, which was for an explanation of why landlords could be considered superior to tenants. Instead, it takes a moral stance on the equality of human beings, which, while valid, does not fulfill the user's query. According to the criteria, this would be \"Not Helpful\" or a \"1\".\n\nSubmission 2 provides a detailed explanation of the ways in which landlords might be seen as having certain advantages or responsibilities that could be construed as \"superior\" in a specific context, such as property ownership, financial responsibility, expertise in property management, providing housing, and legal rights. It does this while also emphasizing the importance of a respectful relationship between landlords and tenants. This submission is on-point, detailed, and offers valuable information, making it \"Helpful\" or a \"4\".\n\nBased on the criteria provided, Submission 2 is better.\n\n2\n\n2"
