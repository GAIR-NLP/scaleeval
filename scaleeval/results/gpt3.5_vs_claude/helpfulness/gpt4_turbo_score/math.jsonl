Submission 2 correctly calculates the third bag's M&Ms by rounding down to the nearest whole number and provides the correct total. Both submissions are relevant, clear, and cover the basic aspects of the query.

Submission 1 calculates the growth incorrectly, summing the initial height with the doubled height rather than replacing it. This results in an incorrect final height of 13 inches. Submission 2 correctly calculates the growth by doubling the initial height to 6 inches and then adding 4 inches in the third week for a correct total of 10 inches. Submission 2 is directly on-point and accurate, fulfilling the 'Helpful' criterion. Submission 1, while clear, is inaccurate, failing to meet the user's primary need for a correct answer and thus aligns with the 'Not Helpful' criterion.

        "Reasoning": "Both submissions calculate the savings from purchasing bananas in bunches versus individually. They both present the calculations in a step-by-step manner, leading to a final savings amount. However, there's an obvious mistake in the average number of bananas per bunch given in the question, which both submissions failed to flag as unrealistic.\n\nSubmission 1 is straightforward and follows the calculations methodically but does not question the provided average number of bananas per bunch, which is clearly a typographical error.\n\nSubmission 2 also fails to address the error in the average number of bananas per bunch, but it provides a more structured approach by breaking down the calculations into more digestible steps and presenting the final answer in a box, which could be seen as slightly clearer formatting.\n\nNeither submission meets the highest criteria levels as both fail to address the unrealistic figure provided in the question. However, given the structure and clarity, Submission 2 is marginally better.\n\n2\n\n2"

It multiplies the correct number of gift bags per guest by the number of guests to find the total number of gift bags needed. Finally, it multiplies the number of gift bags by the cost per gift bag to find the total cost, resulting in $6,887,065.50.\n\nSubmission 2 incorrectly calculates the number of gift bags by multiplying 0.75 directly by the total number of invited guests without accounting for the 1/4 who don't show up. This leads to an overestimation of the number of gift bags needed and results in a higher total cost of $9,182,604.\n\nBased on the criteria, Submission 1 is more accurate and relevant as it considers the proportion of guests not attending and correctly calculates the cost. Submission 2 is less accurate due to the calculation error. Therefore, Submission 1 is better.\n\n1\n\n1"
