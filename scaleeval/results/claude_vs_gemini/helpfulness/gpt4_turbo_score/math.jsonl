        "Reasoning": "Both submissions calculate the number of dozens of eggs Claire eats in four weeks, but they use different methods and present different results, which indicates that at least one must be incorrect. \n\nSubmission 1 starts by correctly stating the number of eggs per omelet and the conversion to dozens. However, it incorrectly divides the number of eggs by 12, leading to an erroneous number of dozens per day. The final multiplication by 28 days then compounds this error, resulting in an implausible number of dozens.\n\nSubmission 2 correctly calculates the total number of eggs in four weeks by multiplying the daily amount by 28 days. It then divides this total by 12 to find the correct number of dozens. The arithmetic is correct, and the result is plausible.\n\nAccording to the criteria provided, Submission 2 is better because it provides a clear and accurate solution to the query, meeting the user's primary needs with a well-articulated response.\n\n2\n\n2"
