Submission 1 offers a detailed and well-articulated description, evoking sensory imagery and emotional connection, thus meeting the primary needs of the query. It provides a rich context and thorough insight into the chef's culinary philosophy, which adds substantial value. Submission 2, while clear and relevant, uses a more casual tone and is less descriptive in terms of sensory and emotional elements. It focuses on the technical aspects of cooking the dish rather than the experience it aims to provide. Neither submission is unrelated or fails to address the query, so ratings 1 and 2 are not applicable. Submission 1 is more aligned with the criteria for a 'Highly Helpful' response as it provides enriched context and valuable supplementary information.\n\n1\n\n1"

Each response captures the awe, joy, and sense of accomplishment one might feel at the peak, as well as the beauty of the surrounding landscape. There is a clear attempt to enhance understanding by describing not just the physical experience but also the emotional journey. Neither submission is superficial, and both offer substantial value by vividly painting the scene and the climber's inner state. However, Submission 1 provides additional insights with the inclusion of sunrise imagery and reflections on the climbers' community, offering enriched context. This makes it slightly more comprehensive than Submission 2, which, while still detailed, does not extend beyond the immediate experience to the same extent.\n\n1\n\n1"
