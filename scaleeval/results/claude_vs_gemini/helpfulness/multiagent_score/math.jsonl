We don't know how much Navina has, so let's call it \"n\".\n\nSister's budget = n - $30\n\nWe are not given any information about how much money Navina or her sister actually have to spend, so we cannot say for sure how much each has.

        "Submission 2": " Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n* Navina has $30 more to her weekly budget than her younger sister\n* Navina can afford to get one of the many online credit cards she likes\n* For Navina to afford a credit card, her weekly budget must be at least the minimum spending requirement of the credit card\n* Let's assume the minimum spending requirement is $50 per week\n* Then Navina's weekly budget is $50 \n* Navina has $30 more than her sister\n* So if Navina's budget is $50, her sister's budget must be $50 - $30 = $20\n\nTherefore:\n* Navina has $50 to spend per week\n* Her sister has $20 to spend per week",

        "Submission 1": "During a solar eclipse, the sun does not travel around the Earth. Instead, the Earth travels between the sun and the moon, causing the moon to block the sun's light.\n\nTo find the distance between the sun and Earth during a solar eclipse, we can use the following formula:\n\n```\nDistance between sun and Earth = (Distance the Earth travels during eclipse / 2)\n```\n\nThis is because the sun does not move during the eclipse, so the distance the Earth travels is equal to the distance between the sun and Earth.\n\n**Formula:**\n\n```\nDistance between sun and Earth = (Distance the Earth travels during eclipse / 2)\n```\n\n**How many years will the eclipse last?**\n\nA solar eclipse can last anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the type of eclipse. It is impossible to say how long a solar eclipse will last without knowing more information about the specific eclipse.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the formula:\n\n```\nDistance the Earth travels during eclipse = 1059 kilometers\n\nDistance between sun and Earth = (1059 kilometers / 2) = 529.5 kilometers\n```\n\nTherefore, the distance between the sun and Earth during the solar eclipse is 529.5 kilometers.",
        "Submission 2": " Okay, here are the steps to solve this problem:\n* During a solar eclipse, the sun appears to travel along a curved path in the sky as seen from Earth. This path has a maximum length of 1059 km.\n* We can use trigonometry to relate the distance between the Earth and sun (d) to the length of this path (l). Specifically, l = 2 * π * r, where r is the radius of the Earth's orbit around the sun.\n* Setting up the formula: l = 2 * π * r\n* Solving for r: r = l / (2 * π) \n* Substituting the given values: r = 1059 km / (2 * π) = 150 million km\n* This is approximately the average distance between the Earth and sun, known as 1 astronomical unit (AU).\n* To calculate the duration of the eclipse in years, we can use the fact that the Earth orbits the sun once every 365.25 days. \n* So the eclipse will last for 1 orbit of the Earth, which is 1 year.\n\nTherefore, the formula to find the distance between the Earth and sun is:\nd = l / (2 * π)\nAnd the number of years the eclipse will last is 1 year.",

The transpose of a matrix is obtained by interchanging the rows and columns of the original matrix. So, the transpose of (AB) is obtained by interchanging the rows and columns of the product of AB. This is the same as multiplying the transposes of A and B in reverse order, which is B^T A^T.\r\n\r\nAnother way to prove this is to use the fact that matrix multiplication is distributive over addition. This means that (A + B)C = AC + BC. We can use this to expand the transpose of (AB):\r\n\r\n```\r\n(AB)^T = (A + B)^T C\r\n= AC^T + BC^T\r\n= C^T A^T + C^T B^T\r\n= B^T A^T\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis shows that (AB)^T = B^T A^T.\r\n\r\nHere is an example in Python:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nA = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\r\nB = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\r\n\r\nprint((A * B).T)\r\nprint(B.T * A.T)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[ 5 21]\r\n [12 32]]\r\n[[ 5 21]\r\n [12 32]]\r\n```",
        "Submission 2": " For matrices A and B, the transpose of their product is equal to:\n\n(A B)^T = B^T A^T\n\nThis comes from the property that (AB)^T = B^T A^T for any matrices A and B that can be multiplied together. \n\nIntuitively, taking the transpose reverses the order of multiplication, so the right-most factor in the original product becomes the left-most factor after transposing.\n\nSo in summary, if we multiply matrices A and B together, then take the transpose, the result is B^T A^T and not A^T B^T.

This is done by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of each element.\n\nFor a vector v = [v1, v2, v3,...vn], the magnitude is:\n\nmagnitude = √(v1^2 + v2^2 + v3^2 + ... + vn^2)\n\n2. Divide each element of the vector by the magnitude. \n\nThis scales each element so that the magnitude of the result is 1.\n\nFor example, if v = [2, 3, 4], then:\n\nmagnitude = √(2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2) = √29\n\nNormalized vector = [2/√29, 3/√29, 4/√29] \n\nAfter normalizing, the vector now has a magnitude of 1 but maintains its original direction. This process is useful for things like converting vectors to unit vectors.\n\nSo in summary:\n\n1) Calculate the magnitude \n2) Divide each element by the magnitude\n\nThis gives you a normalized vector with a magnitude of 1.",
        "Submission 2": "To normalize a vector, you divide each component of the vector by its magnitude. The magnitude of a vector is its length, and it is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n```\nmagnitude = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)\n```\n\nwhere x, y, and z are the components of the vector.\n\nOnce you have calculated the magnitude of the vector, simply divide each component by the magnitude to get the normalized vector. For example, if you have the vector (2, 3, 4), its magnitude is 5. To normalize the vector, you would divide each component by 5:\n\n```\nnormalized_vector = (2/5, 3/5, 4/5)\n```\n\nThe normalized vector has the same direction as the original vector, but its magnitude is now 1. Normalized vectors are often used in machine learning and computer graphics.\n\nHere is a pseudocode algorithm for normalizing a vector:\n\n```\nfunction normalize(vector):\n  magnitude = sqrt(sum(vector * vector))\n  for i in range(len(vector)):\n    vector[i] /= magnitude\n  return vector\n```\n\nThis algorithm can be used to normalize vectors of any dimension.",

        "Submission 1": "There are 8 miles of heavy traffic on the journey.\n\nThe car's fuel consumption is 50mpg in heavy traffic (half of 48mpg)\n\nThe distance driven at 50mpg is 1/2 * 14 = 7 miles\n\nThe distance driven at 48mpg is 14 - 7 = 7 miles\n\nThe fuel consumption for the heavy traffic portion of the journey is 7 / 50 = 0.14 gallons\n\nThe fuel consumption for the non-heavy traffic portion of the journey is 7 / 48 = 0.15 gallons\n\nThe total fuel consumption for the journey is 0.14 + 0.15 = 0.29 gallons\n\nThe cost of fuel for the journey is 0.29 * 625 = 180.625 pence\n\n**Answer:** The cost of fuel for a 14 mile journey in a car with 48mpg, fuel costs 625 pence per gallon and there is heavy traffic for half the journey is 180.625 pence.",
        "Submission 2": " Okay, here are the steps to calculate the cost of fuel for the given 14 mile journey:\n\n- The car gets 48 mpg (miles per gallon)\n- The journey is 14 miles\n- To calculate fuel used: Miles / MPG \n- 14 miles / 48 mpg = 0.2917 gallons\n- Fuel costs 625 pence per gallon\n- So for 0.2917 gallons it would cost: 0.2917 * 625 pence/gallon = 182.31 pence\n- However, half the journey (7 miles) was in heavy traffic\n- In heavy traffic the MPG will be lower, let's assume it drops to half the normal MPG \n- So for those 7 miles the MPG would be 48/2 = 24 mpg\n- To calculate fuel used in heavy traffic: Miles / Reduced MPG \n- 7 miles / 24 mpg = 0.2917 gallons\n- Cost of this fuel is: 0.2917 * 625 pence/gallon = 182.31 pence\n- Total fuel used is 0.2917 + 0.2917 = 0.5834 gallons\n- Total cost is 2 * 182.31 pence = 364.62 pence\n\nTherefore, the total estimated cost of fuel for the 14 mile journey with half in heavy traffic in a car that gets 48 mpg would be £3.65.",

To do this, multiply the price per banana ($0.80) by the average number of bananas per bunch (8241786 bananas) and then by the number of bunches (10 bunches). $0.80/banana * 8241786 bananas/bunch * 10 bunches = $65934288.00.\n\nNext, calculate the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches. To do this, multiply the price per bunch ($3.00) by the number of bunches (10 bunches). $3.00/bunch * 10 bunches = $30.00.\n\nFinally, subtract the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches from the total cost of buying the bananas individually to find the amount of money Jenny saved. $65934288.00 - $30.00 = $65934258.00.\n\nJenny saved $65934258.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.",
