It meets criteria 4 and 5 by being directly on point, detailed, well-articulated, and offering valuable information and context. \n\nSubmission 2 also shows work to calculate total distance and relate it to water needed. It is also direct, detailed, and clear. However, it does not provide quite as much supplementary information and context as Submission 1. It meets criteria 4 but not quite 5.\n\nBased on meeting more criteria at a higher level, Submission 1 is better.\n\n1\n\n1"

It goes beyond just stating the final result to show the calculations made each week.

Submission 1 presents the calculations in clear steps and explains the logic, meeting the key aspects of the query. Submission 2 also demonstrates the calculations clearly and covers the basics of the question, but provides slightly more context by introducing the players (Mr Rogers and his friend).

Submission 2 provides more context by explicitly listing the key information from the question such as the number of invited guests and gift bags needed per guest. It also structures the steps more clearly into calculating number of gift bags and then the total cost. The calculations are correct in both. Overall, Submission 2 demonstrates better organization, clarity and completeness. \n\nBased on the criteria, Submission 2 rates higher on being directly on-point, detailed, well-articulated, and providing more context.
