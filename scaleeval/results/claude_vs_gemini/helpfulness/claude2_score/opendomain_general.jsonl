It covers the key aspects like using a password as the first factor, a one-time code sent to your phone as the second factor, the purpose of adding extra security beyond just a password, and examples of common second factor verification methods. The explanation is relevant, coherent, and comprehensive in addressing the user's informational needs. \n\nIn contrast, Submission 2 is completely unrelated to the question and provides no meaningful information.\n\nBased strictly on the criteria provided, Submission 1 is clearly better as it fully meets the requirements for a \"Highly Helpful\" response by being exceptionally thorough, precise, and supplemented with valuable context. Submission 2 fails to address the user's query at all.\n\n1\n\n1"

Submission 1 offers more comprehensive coverage, with 10 specific recommendations spanning dedicated workspace, routines, minimizing distractions, using productivity tools, taking breaks, planning and prioritization, goal-setting, rewards, and self-care. The tips are more detailed and actionable. In contrast, Submission 2 provides 9 high-level tips lacking specifics. While still valuable, Submission 2 is not as thorough in addressing all aspects of the question and providing depth. Based on the criteria stating that a 5 rating means exceptional, thorough and precise advice going beyond the query, Submission 1 more closely satisfies the criteria for a 5 rating.\n\n1\n\n1"
