        "Reasoning": "Based on the provided criteria, both submissions are relevant and clear, covering the basic aspects of the query. However, Submission 1 provides a more detailed and comprehensive elucidation of the chemicals affected by L-theanine, including dopamine, glutamate, GABA, alpha brain waves, caffeine metabolism, cortisol, and NMDA receptors. Submission 2, while also relevant, focuses more on the potential health benefits of L-theanine and its effects on neurotransmitters. Therefore, Submission 1 is more helpful as it offers a deeper understanding of the specific chemicals and processes affected by L-theanine.\n\n2"
