This response is accurate and aligns with the mathematical principles relevant to the question.\n\nSubmission 2 incorrectly calculates the total number of raspberries in the clusters (6 * 7077300 = 4244380,000), introducing a decimal and extra zeros that are not present in the correct calculation. This error leads to an incorrect total number of raspberries (4244380,067).\n\nBased on the provided criteria, Submission 1 demonstrates \"Mastery\" as it provides an accurate solution and follows the correct mathematical principles. Submission 2 falls into the \"Beginning\" category due to the fundamental mathematical error leading to an entirely incorrect solution.\n\n1\n\n1"

        "Reasoning": "To evaluate the submissions, we need to check the accuracy of the calculations and the adherence to mathematical principles. Both submissions calculate the number of M&Ms in the first and second bags correctly. However, they differ in the third bag's calculation. Submission 1 rounds the half of the first bag's M&Ms to the nearest whole number, which is correct since you cannot have a half M&M. Submission 2 incorrectly includes a fractional M&M. The final totals given by each submission also reflect this discrepancy. According to the criteria, accuracy and a sound understanding of the problem are key.\n\nSubmission 1 correctly rounds the half number of M&Ms to a whole number and provides an accurate total, aligning with the criteria for a higher score. Submission 2 contains a fundamental error by including a half M&M in the total count, which is not possible in the given context. This is a significant error, as M&Ms are indivisible items.\n\nTherefore, based on the evaluation:\nSubmission 1 is better: \"1\"\n\n1"
