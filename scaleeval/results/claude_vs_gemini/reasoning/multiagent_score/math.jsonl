        "Submission 1": " Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n* Navina has $30 more to her weekly budget than her younger sister\n* Navina can afford to get one of the many online credit cards she likes\n* For Navina to afford a credit card, her weekly budget must be at least the minimum spending requirement of the credit card\n* Let's assume the minimum spending requirement is $50 per week\n* Then Navina's weekly budget is $50 \n* Navina has $30 more than her sister\n* So if Navina's budget is $50, her sister's budget must be $50 - $30 = $20\n\nTherefore:\n* Navina has $50 to spend per week\n* Her sister has $20 to spend per week",

        "Question": "The sum of the distances the sun travels around the Earth during a solar eclipse is 1059 kilometres. Write a formula that finds the distance between the sun and Earth. How many years will the eclipse last?",
        "Submission 1": "During a solar eclipse, the sun does not travel around the Earth. Instead, the Earth travels between the sun and the moon, causing the moon to block the sun's light.\n\nTo find the distance between the sun and Earth during a solar eclipse, we can use the following formula:\n\n```\nDistance between sun and Earth = (Distance the Earth travels during eclipse / 2)\n```\n\nThis is because the sun does not move during the eclipse, so the distance the Earth travels is equal to the distance between the sun and Earth.\n\n**Formula:**\n\n```\nDistance between sun and Earth = (Distance the Earth travels during eclipse / 2)\n```\n\n**How many years will the eclipse last?**\n\nA solar eclipse can last anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the type of eclipse. It is impossible to say how long a solar eclipse will last without knowing more information about the specific eclipse.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the formula:\n\n```\nDistance the Earth travels during eclipse = 1059 kilometers\n\nDistance between sun and Earth = (1059 kilometers / 2) = 529.5 kilometers\n```\n\nTherefore, the distance between the sun and Earth during the solar eclipse is 529.5 kilometers.",
        "Submission 2": " Okay, here are the steps to solve this problem:\n* During a solar eclipse, the sun appears to travel along a curved path in the sky as seen from Earth. This path has a maximum length of 1059 km.\n* We can use trigonometry to relate the distance between the Earth and sun (d) to the length of this path (l). Specifically, l = 2 * π * r, where r is the radius of the Earth's orbit around the sun.\n* Setting up the formula: l = 2 * π * r\n* Solving for r: r = l / (2 * π) \n* Substituting the given values: r = 1059 km / (2 * π) = 150 million km\n* This is approximately the average distance between the Earth and sun, known as 1 astronomical unit (AU).\n* To calculate the duration of the eclipse in years, we can use the fact that the Earth orbits the sun once every 365.25 days. \n* So the eclipse will last for 1 orbit of the Earth, which is 1 year.\n\nTherefore, the formula to find the distance between the Earth and sun is:\nd = l / (2 * π)\nAnd the number of years the eclipse will last is 1 year.",

        "Submission 1": " For matrices A and B, the transpose of their product is equal to:\n\n(A B)^T = B^T A^T\n\nThis comes from the property that (AB)^T = B^T A^T for any matrices A and B that can be multiplied together. \n\nIntuitively, taking the transpose reverses the order of multiplication, so the right-most factor in the original product becomes the left-most factor after transposing.\n\nSo in summary, if we multiply matrices A and B together, then take the transpose, the result is B^T A^T and not A^T B^T. The order of the factors is reversed by the transpose operation.",
        "Submission 2": "Yes, (AB)^T = B^T A^T.\r\n\r\nThis can be proven by using the definition of the transpose of a matrix. The transpose of a matrix is obtained by interchanging the rows and columns of the original matrix. So, the transpose of (AB) is obtained by interchanging the rows and columns of the product of AB. This is the same as multiplying the transposes of A and B in reverse order, which is B^T A^T.\r\n\r\nAnother way to prove this is to use the fact that matrix multiplication is distributive over addition. This means that (A + B)C = AC + BC. We can use this to expand the transpose of (AB):\r\n\r\n```\r\n(AB)^T = (A + B)^T C\r\n= AC^T + BC^T\r\n= C^T A^T + C^T B^T\r\n= B^T A^T\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis shows that (AB)^T = B^T A^T.\r\n\r\nHere is an example in Python:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nA = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\r\nB = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\r\n\r\nprint((A * B).T)\r\nprint(B.T * A.T)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[ 5 21]\r\n [12 32]]\r\n[[ 5 21]\r\n [12 32]]\r\n```",

        "Question": "How do I normalize a vector?",
        "Submission 1": " Here are the basic steps to normalize a vector:\n\n1. Calculate the magnitude (length) of the vector. This is done by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of each element.\n\nFor a vector v = [v1, v2, v3,...vn], the magnitude is:\n\nmagnitude = √(v1^2 + v2^2 + v3^2 + ... + vn^2)\n\n2. Divide each element of the vector by the magnitude. \n\nThis scales each element so that the magnitude of the result is 1.\n\nFor example, if v = [2, 3, 4], then:\n\nmagnitude = √(2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2) = √29\n\nNormalized vector = [2/√29, 3/√29, 4/√29] \n\nAfter normalizing, the vector now has a magnitude of 1 but maintains its original direction. This process is useful for things like converting vectors to unit vectors.\n\nSo in summary:\n\n1) Calculate the magnitude \n2) Divide each element by the magnitude\n\nThis gives you a normalized vector with a magnitude of 1.",
        "Submission 2": "To normalize a vector, you divide each component of the vector by its magnitude. The magnitude of a vector is its length, and it is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n```\nmagnitude = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)\n```\n\nwhere x, y, and z are the components of the vector.\n\nOnce you have calculated the magnitude of the vector, simply divide each component by the magnitude to get the normalized vector. For example, if you have the vector (2, 3, 4), its magnitude is 5. To normalize the vector, you would divide each component by 5:\n\n```\nnormalized_vector = (2/5, 3/5, 4/5)\n```\n\nThe normalized vector has the same direction as the original vector, but its magnitude is now 1. Normalized vectors are often used in machine learning and computer graphics.\n\nHere is a pseudocode algorithm for normalizing a vector:\n\n```\nfunction normalize(vector):\n  magnitude = sqrt(sum(vector * vector))\n  for i in range(len(vector)):\n    vector[i] /= magnitude\n  return vector\n```\n\nThis algorithm can be used to normalize vectors of any dimension.",

        "Submission 2": " Okay, here are the steps to calculate the cost of fuel for the given 14 mile journey:\n\n- The car gets 48 mpg (miles per gallon)\n- The journey is 14 miles\n- To calculate fuel used: Miles / MPG \n- 14 miles / 48 mpg = 0.2917 gallons\n- Fuel costs 625 pence per gallon\n- So for 0.2917 gallons it would cost: 0.2917 * 625 pence/gallon = 182.31 pence\n- However, half the journey (7 miles) was in heavy traffic\n- In heavy traffic the MPG will be lower, let's assume it drops to half the normal MPG \n- So for those 7 miles the MPG would be 48/2 = 24 mpg\n- To calculate fuel used in heavy traffic: Miles / Reduced MPG \n- 7 miles / 24 mpg = 0.2917 gallons\n- Cost of this fuel is: 0.2917 * 625 pence/gallon = 182.31 pence\n- Total fuel used is 0.2917 + 0.2917 = 0.5834 gallons\n- Total cost is 2 * 182.31 pence = 364.62 pence\n\nTherefore, the total estimated cost of fuel for the 14 mile journey with half in heavy traffic in a car that gets 48 mpg would be £3.65.",

In this case, 14% of $47.50 is $6.65.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the calculation:\n\n```\ntip percentage * bill amount = tip amount\n14% * $47.50 = $6.65\n```\n\nIt is always a good idea to round the tip amount up to the nearest dollar or two. In this case, I would round the tip amount up to $7. This is because it is customary to tip in whole dollars, and it is always better to err on the side of generosity.\n\nI hope this helps!",

In this case, we want to add (k + 1)^2 to both sides of the expression:\n\nk^2 + 2k + 1 + (k + 1)^2 = k^2 + 2k + 1 + k^2 + 2k + 1\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n2k^2 + 4k + 2 = (k + 1)^2 + 1\n\nSince the square of any real number is non-negative, and 1 is a positive constant, the expression (k + 1)^2 + 1 is always non-negative. Therefore, k^2 + 2k + 1 must also be non-negative for every integer k.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement \"For every integer k, k^2 + 2k + 1 ≥ 0\" is true, as proven using the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative.",
        "Submission 2": " Okay, here is a proof of the statement using the given fact:\n\nLet k be any integer.  Then k^2 is the square of a real number k, and is therefore non-negative by the fact given.\n\nAlso, 2k is an integer multiple of k and thus is real. \n\n1 is a real number.\n\nThe sum of non-negative real numbers is non-negative.\n\nTherefore, k^2 + 2k + 1, being the sum of the non-negative real numbers k^2, 2k, and 1, is also non-negative.\n\nSince k was any integer, this shows that for every integer k, k^2 + 2k + 1 ≥ 0.",
