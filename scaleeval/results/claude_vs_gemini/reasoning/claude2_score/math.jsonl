        "Reasoning": " Here is my evaluation reasoning in under 150 words:\n\nSubmission 1 shows competency by outlining the key steps to solve the percentage discount problem correctly. However, it does not provide in-depth explanations. Submission 2 demonstrates proficiency through a systematic approach, accurately calculating each value and clearly showing the work to find the 25% final discount. Minor issues like formatting do not take away from the mathematical preciseness. Overall, Submission 2 aligns more closely with the criteria for mastery with its insightful solution and enhanced comprehension.\n\nTherefore, Submission 2 is better.\n\n2"

        "Reasoning": " Based on the criteria, Submission 2 demonstrates a more competent understanding of the mathematical principles required to solve this word problem. It breaks down the steps clearly and methodically, accounting for the 0.75 gift bags per invited guest and performing the necessary calculations to determine total cost. Aside from minor issues like not defining variables explicitly, the logic and computations are sound. \n\nIn contrast, Submission 1 omits the key step of calculating needed gift bags from invited guests. While the final cost computation is accurate, the response skips over the conversion from invited to attending guests, overlooking essential details. This signifies a less developed mathematical approach.\n\nTherefore, Submission 2 better aligns with criteria level 3 (Competent) by employing reasonably accurate methods and explanations. Submission 1 resembles level 2, with gaps in logic and method. \n\nIn summary:\nSubmission 2 is better\n\n2"
