Submission 1 explores more domains, covering cell theory, genetics, physiology, taxonomy, and microscopy. The ideas flow logically and are reasonably well-developed. Submission 2 goes into greater depth on three key areas - cellular biology, genetics, and mathematical models. The arguments showcase strong logical coherence and reasoning. Overall, Submission 2 showcases slightly stronger logical reasoning due to the greater focus and depth of exploration on the key topics. While Submission 1 covers more ground, Submission 2 develops stronger logical arguments in the areas it focuses on. Based on the criteria emphasizing logical reasoning, Submission 2 is judged to be better.\n\n2\n\n2"
