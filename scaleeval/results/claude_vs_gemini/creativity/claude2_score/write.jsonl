Submission 1 has richer descriptive detail that evokes the timeless, ritualistic nature of the immortal cats more effectively. It paints a vivid picture of the secret feline society within the walls of the building. In contrast, Submission 2 has a more philosophical tone contemplating epistemology from the cats' point of view. While thought-provoking, it lacks the concrete sensory imagery that helps transport the reader into the scene. Based on the criteria emphasizing innovation, depth, and insight, Submission 1 edges out Submission 2 for its superior worldbuilding and ability to compellingly render the inner lives of the immortal cats. It showcases great originality in concept and narrative style.\n\n1\n\n1"

Submission 1 takes a more narrative, first-person perspective following a teenager through typical daily activities.
