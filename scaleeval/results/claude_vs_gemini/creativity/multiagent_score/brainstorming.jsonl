        "Question": "How do I detail a car?",
        "Submission 1": "To detail a car, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Inspect the car and get supplies.** Look for any areas that need special attention, such as bird droppings, tree sap, or road grime. You will also need to gather your supplies, which should include:\n    * A bucket of car wash soap\n    * A sponge or microfiber towel\n    * A hose or pressure washer\n    * A wheel and tire brush\n    * A vacuum cleaner\n    * A glass cleaner\n    * A microfiber cloth\n    * A detailing brush\n    * A wax or sealant\n\n2. **Empty and dust the interior.** Remove any loose items from the car and dust the dashboard, door panels, and other hard surfaces. You can use a vacuum cleaner or a compressed air can to get into the tight spots.\n\n3. **Vacuum the interior.** Vacuum the floors, seats, and cargo area. Be sure to remove the floor mats and vacuum underneath them as well.\n\n4. **Clean the hard interior surfaces.** Use a mild all-purpose cleaner to clean the dashboard, door panels, and other hard surfaces. Be sure to avoid using harsh chemicals that could damage the interior.\n\n5. **Clean the car seats.** The type of car seat cleaner you use will depend on the material of your seats. For fabric seats, you can use a foam cleaner or a steam cleaner. For leather seats, you can use a leather cleaner and conditioner.\n\n6. **Clean the tires and wheels.** Use a wheel and tire cleaner to remove brake dust and road grime from the wheels and tires. Be sure to clean the inside and outside of the wheels, as well as the tires themselves.\n\n7. **Wash the exterior.** Start by rinsing the car with water to remove any loose dirt or debris. Then, mix a bucket of car wash soap and water. Use a sponge or microfiber towel to wash the car from top to bottom, starting with the roof and working your way down. Be sure to rinse the car thoroughly with water after washing.\n\n8. **Polish the paint.** If your car's paint is looking dull or faded, you can polish it to restore its shine. Apply a small amount of polish to a microfiber cloth and buff the paint in a circular motion.\n\n9. **Clean the metal trim.** Use a metal cleaner to clean the chrome and aluminum trim on your car. Be sure to avoid using harsh chemicals that could damage the trim.\n\n10. **Wax on.** Apply a coat of wax or sealant to protect the car's paint and keep it looking its best. Apply the wax or sealant to a microfiber cloth and buff it onto the paint in a circular motion.\n\n11. **Clean exterior windows.** Use a glass cleaner to clean the exterior windows. Be sure to wipe the windows in a circular motion to avoid streaks.\n\n12. **Optional: Cleaning the engine bay.** If you want to clean the engine bay, use a degreaser to remove any dirt or grime. Be sure to avoid getting any water on the electrical components.\n\nOnce you have completed all of these steps, your car should be looking and feeling its best!",
        "Submission 2": " Here are some basic steps for detailing a car:\n\n- Wash - Thoroughly wash the exterior with a car wash soap or shampoo. Use two buckets - one for soapy water and one for rinse water. This prevents dirty rinse water from re-soiling the car.\n\n- Decontaminate - Clay the paint to remove embedded contaminants. Products like tar and fallout remover can help with specific spots. \n\n- Polish - For minor scratches and swirl marks, use a polishing or rubbing compound by hand or with an orbital polisher. Start with a lighter cut and work up to remove imperfections. \n\n- Protect - Apply a quality wax or sealant like carnauba or polymer sealant to add gloss and protection. Ceramic coatings offer even more durable protection.\n\n- Interior - Vacuum upholstery, carpets, and floors. Wipe down dash, doors, and center console. Clean vinyl, plastic, and leather surfaces. Shampoo carpets.\n\n- Glass - Clean all glass inside and out with a glass cleaner or vinegar solution. Polish any etched glass. \n\n- Wheels - Remove wheels if possible for a deeper clean. Otherwise clean around brakes and lug nuts. Use a wheel cleaner or all-purpose solution. \n\n- Tires - Dress tires with a rubber/vinyl dressing to restore black color. \n\n- Final touches - Clean door jambs, rubber seals/trim, and under the hood. Apply interior protectant/dressing as needed.\n\nTaking your time and following the steps will yield the best results. Consider a paint correction for deeper cleaning of oxidation or swirls.",

        "Question": "What are the most effective ways to deal with stress?",
        "Submission 1": " Here are some effective ways to deal with stress:\n\n- Exercise regularly. Physical activity releases endorphins that make you feel good and can help relieve tension and stress. Even a 30-minute walk can help.\n\n- Practice deep breathing. Taking deep breaths helps relax your body and calm your mind. Try breathing in for 5 seconds, holding for 5, and exhaling for 5.\n\n- Get enough sleep. Feeling well-rested helps your body cope with stress. Most adults need 7-9 hours per night. \n\n- Eat a healthy diet. Consuming nutritious, whole foods gives your body and mind fuel to handle stress. Limit caffeine, sugar, and processed foods.\n\n- Spend time in nature. Being outdoors can reset your nervous system and reduce stress and anxiety. Even looking at photos of nature can help. \n\n- Practice meditation or yoga. Activities like meditation, yoga, and tai chi can help calm your mind and relax your body. Many apps offer guided sessions.\n\n- Talk to someone. Sharing your feelings with a friend or making an appointment with a therapist allows you to vent and get an outside perspective. \n\n- Take breaks during the day. Short breaks every 90 minutes or so allow you to recharge. Taking vacations from work can also help manage long-term stress.\n\n- Pick a hobby. Engaging in enjoyable activities you find meaningful, like art, music, cooking, etc. takes your mind off stressors.",
        "Submission 2": "The most effective ways to deal with stress vary from person to person, but some common and well-supported strategies include:\n\n* **Exercise regularly.** Exercise is a great way to reduce stress hormones and improve mood. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week.\n* **Get enough sleep.** When you're well-rested, you're better able to cope with stress. Most adults need 7-8 hours of sleep per night.\n* **Eat a healthy diet.** Eating nutritious foods gives your body the fuel it needs to handle stress. Avoid processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive amounts of caffeine and alcohol.\n* **Learn relaxation techniques.** Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, and yoga can help to calm the mind and body. There are many different relaxation techniques available, so find one that works best for you.\n* **Connect with others.** Spending time with loved ones can help to reduce stress and provide social support. Make time for activities that you enjoy with people you care about.\n\nOther helpful strategies for dealing with stress include:\n\n* **Identify and avoid your stressors.** If possible, try to avoid the situations or people that trigger your stress. If you can't avoid your stressors, develop coping mechanisms for dealing with them.\n* **Set realistic expectations.** Don't try to do too much at once. Set realistic goals for yourself and break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable ones.\n* **Learn to say no.** It's okay to say no to requests if you're feeling overwhelmed. Don't be afraid to set boundaries and protect your time and energy.\n* **Take breaks.** Schedule time for yourself throughout the day to relax and recharge. Get up and move around, step outside for some fresh air, or do something that you enjoy.\n\nIf you're struggling to manage your stress on your own, talk to your doctor or a mental health professional. They can help you to develop a personalized stress management plan and teach you additional coping skills.",

Wear layers of clothing so that you can adjust to the changing temperature. Be sure to wear a waterproof jacket and pants, and bring an umbrella or raincoat.\n* Wear waterproof shoes or boots. This will help to keep your feet dry and prevent blisters.\n* Be aware of your surroundings. Be careful walking on wet surfaces, and avoid areas where there is flooding.\n* Take breaks often. If you start to get too wet or cold, take a break indoors to warm up and dry off.\n\nI hope this list gives you some ideas for outdoor activities that you can enjoy even in the rain.",
        "Submission 2": " Here is a list of outdoor activities that would be suitable for a temperature of 57Â°F with showers:\n\n- Hiking on trails that are covered or have shelter nearby in case of rain\n- Biking along paved paths or roads \n- Jogging or running along routes with shelter options\n- Picnicking under shelters or tents at parks\n- Birdwatching from covered areas or indoor centers\n- Photography walks looking for subjects tolerant of rain\n- Mushroom or plant foraging in wooded areas with overhead shelter  \n- Fishing from piers, docks or shorelines with shelter nearby\n- Zoo or botanical garden visits that have indoor exhibits and greenhouses\n- Outdoor mall or shopping center walking between covered areas\n- Playground activities under covered structures \n- Outdoor museum grounds that have covered walkways and indoor exhibits\n\nThe key is looking for activities that can be easily moved under cover if light rain develops, as the temperature would still allow being outside if dry or protected from precipitation for short periods.",

        "Submission 1": "Here are some helpful activities and conversation starters to use at meetups to break the ice:\n\n**Activities:**\n\n* **Two Truths and a Lie:** Each person shares two truths and one lie about themselves, and the others have to guess which one is the lie. This is a fun and easy way to get to know people and learn some interesting facts about them.\n* **Would You Rather?:** This is a classic icebreaker where people are presented with two hypothetical choices and have to pick which one they would rather do. For example, \"Would you rather be able to fly or be invisible?\" This is a great way to learn about people's preferences and values.\n* **Human Bingo:** Create a bingo board with different interests or experiences on it, and have people walk around and find other people who have those things in common. This is a great way to help people connect with others who share their interests.\n* **Scavenger Hunt:** Create a scavenger hunt list of items that people can find around the meetup space. This is a fun and active way to get people moving and interacting with each other.\n\n**Conversation Starters:**\n\n* **What is your favorite thing about yourself?**\n* **What is something you're passionate about?**\n* **What is one thing you're looking forward to at this meetup?**\n* **What is one thing you've learned recently that you found interesting?**\n* **If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?**\n* **What is your favorite book/movie/TV show/podcast?**\n* **What is one thing you're on a mission to accomplish?**\n* **What is one thing you're grateful for today?**\n\nYou can also use conversation starters that are specific to the meetup topic or theme. For example, if you're having a meetup for tech enthusiasts, you could ask conversation starters like:\n\n* **What is your favorite programming language?**\n* **What is the most challenging tech project you've ever worked on?**\n* **What is one tech trend you're excited about?**\n* **What is one tech skill you're hoping to learn next?**\n\nNo matter what activities or conversation starters you choose, the most important thing is to create a welcoming and inclusive environment where people feel comfortable getting to know each other.",

If you are using a converter, twist the piston knob in the opposite direction to draw ink into the converter. If you are using a cartridge, simply insert it into the pen and press firmly until it clicks into place.\n5. Once the converter or cartridge is full, remove the nib from the ink bottle.\n6. Wipe off any excess ink from the nib and section of the pen.\n7. Reassemble the pen by screwing the barrel back onto the section.\n8.

        "Submission 2": " Here are the basic steps to refill an antique fountain pen:\n\n1. Unscrew the barrel (the cylindrical part that houses the nib and ink reservoir) from the rest of the pen. \n\n2. Rinse out any remaining ink in the reservoir with clean water to remove residue. You can use a bulb syringe or pipette to help remove the water. \n\n3. Gently blot or air dry the reservoir until it's completely dry. Do not use paper towels as they can snag.\n\n4. Place a few drops of ink (3-5 drops is usually sufficient) directly into the ink reservoir. Do not overfill.\n\n5. Carefully screw the barrel back onto the rest of the pen. Do not over tighten.\n\n6. Draw the plunger up several times to draw the ink down into the feed. This primes the ink flow. \n\n7. Wipe any excess ink off the nib/feed area with a cloth. \n\n8. Your pen should now be ready to write. Test it on a piece of scrap paper. \n\n9. Periodically repeat steps 1-3 to clean and refill as the ink levels run low.

        "Question": "I'm trying to learn how to install window blinds.",
        "Submission 1": "Installing window blinds is a relatively easy process that can be done in a few simple steps.\n\nHere are the general steps on how to install window blinds:\n\n1. **Gather your materials.** You will need the following materials:\n    * Window blinds\n    * Measuring tape\n    * Pencil\n    * Level\n    * Drill\n    * Screwdriver\n    * Studfinder (optional)\n\n[Image of Window blinds]\n[Image of Measuring tape]\n[Image of Pencil]\n[Image of Level]\n[Image of Drill]\n[Image of Screwdriver]\n[Image of Studfinder]\n\n2. **Choose a mounting location.** You can mount your window blinds inside or outside the window frame. Inside-mount blinds will be more flush with the window, while outside-mount blinds will give you more light control.\n\n[Image of Inside-mount blinds]\n[Image of Outside-mount blinds]\n\n3. **Measure your window.** If you are mounting your blinds inside the window frame, measure the width of the window opening. If you are mounting your blinds outside the window frame, measure the width of the window opening plus the depth of the window frame.\n\n4. **Mark the mounting locations.** Use a level to mark the mounting locations for the brackets on the wall or window frame. Make sure the markings are evenly spaced.\n\n5. **Pre-drill the holes.** Use a drill bit that is slightly smaller than the screws you will be using to pre-drill the holes for the brackets.\n\n6. **Attach the brackets.** Screw the brackets into the wall or window frame using the screws provided.\n\n7. **Hang the blinds.** Slide the blinds into the brackets and make sure they are secure.\n\n8. **Attach the valance (optional).** The valance is the decorative piece that covers the headrail of the blinds. Attach the valance to the headrail using the clips provided.\n\n[Image of Valance]\n\n9. **Test the blinds.** Open and close the blinds to make sure they are working properly.\n\nHere are some additional tips for installing window blinds:\n\n* If you are mounting your blinds inside the window frame, make sure the headrail of the blinds is at least 1/4 inch wider than the window opening. This will help to prevent light from leaking around the edges of the blinds.\n* If you are mounting your blinds outside the window frame, make sure the brackets are at least 1/2 inch wider than the window opening. This will help to provide more light control.\n* If you are unsure about how to install your window blinds, you can always consult the instructions that came with the blinds or contact the manufacturer for assistance.\n\nI hope this helps!",
        "Submission 2": " Here are the basic steps to install window blinds:\n\n1. Measure the window. Measure the width and height of the window opening where the blinds will be installed. Make sure to measure inside the window frame or casing. Take any obstructions like window sills into account as well.\n\n2. Select blind size. Choose a blind that is slightly smaller than your window measurements, typically 1/2 to 1 inch narrower and shorter. This will allow for a proper installation and operation of the blind.\n\n3. Install mounting brackets. Mount brackets at each ends and intermediately spaced along the top of the window frame or casing. Brackets come with installation instructions for your specific bracket and window type. Use proper hardware like screws. \n\n4. Attach blind to brackets. Rotate or tilt the head rail of the blind into the top brackets to secure it in place. The brackets should hold the blind firmly. \n\n5. Install the valance. If included, mount the decorative valance board below the head rail to conceal the brackets and hardware. \n\n6. Add controls and tilting mechanism. Attach the tilt control wand, lifting cords or chain, side tilting mechanism as needed for your specific blind type. \n\n7. Adjust and test. Make sure the blind lifts and lowers smoothly. Test the tilt functionality. Make any needed adjustments to the installation before use.\n\n8. Enjoy your new blinds! Periodically check the blind installation and make any needed tightening or adjustments.\n\nLet me know if you have any other specific questions during your blind installation project! Proper measurement and secure mounting are key.",

        "Question": "Can you give any tips on how to cook a juicy, medium-rare steak?",
        "Submission 1": " Here are some tips for cooking a juicy, medium-rare steak:\n\n- Select steaks that are at least 1 inch thick. Thinner steaks can overcook more easily. \n\n- Bring steaks to room temperature before cooking. This prevents the middle from cooling down too quickly when it hits the hot pan or grill.\n\n- Season steaks generously with salt and pepper on both sides. The salt enhances flavor and helps retain moisture.\n\n- Use a very hot cooking surface like a cast iron skillet or grill. This sears the exterior and locks in the juices. \n\n- Cook steaks for 3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare doneness. Use a meat thermometer and aim for an internal temperature of 130-135Â°F. \n\n- Don't press down on the steaks with a spatula while cooking. This releases precious juices.\n\n- Let steaks rest for at least 5 minutes after cooking. The temperature will continue to rise to 145Â°F for perfect medium-rare doneness. \n\n- For extra juiciness, consider butter basting the steaks during cooking. You can also use compound butters on top after resting.\n\n- Resist the urge to cut into the steak too early after resting. Give it enough time so the juices don't run out.",
        "Submission 2": "Cooking a juicy, medium-rare steak is an art that requires patience, precision, and a touch of finesse. Here are some essential tips to help you achieve that perfectly cooked steak:\n\n1. **Choose the Right Cut:** Select a cut with good marbling, such as ribeye, New York strip, or filet mignon. Marbling, the streaks of fat within the meat, bastes the steak naturally during cooking, resulting in a tender and juicy steak.\n\n2. **Bring the Steak to Room Temperature:** Take the steak out of the refrigerator about 30 minutes before cooking. This allows the meat to cook evenly and prevents the outside from becoming overcooked while the inside remains cold.\n\n3. **Season Generously:** Generously season the steak with salt and pepper on both sides. You can also add other seasonings like garlic powder, onion powder, or paprika for extra flavor.\n\n4. **Preheat the Cooking Surface:** Preheat your cast-iron skillet, grill, or grill pan to medium-high heat. A hot cooking surface is crucial for creating a flavorful sear.\n\n5. **Add a Thin Layer of Oil:** Add a thin layer of high smoke point oil, such as canola or avocado oil, to the hot cooking surface. This helps prevent sticking and promotes even cooking.\n\n6. **Sear the Steak:** Carefully place the steak on the hot cooking surface and let it sear undisturbed for about 2-3 minutes per side for a 1-inch thick steak. Resist the urge to move the steak around, as this disrupts the sear.\n\n7. **Reduce Heat and Baste with Butter (Optional):** Reduce the heat to medium-low and add a tablespoon of butter (optional). Tilt the pan and baste the steak with the melted butter for an extra boost of flavor and richness.\n\n8. **Cook to Desired Doneness:** Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the steak for desired doneness. For medium-rare, the internal temperature should be 130-135Â°F (54-57Â°C).\n\n9. **Let the Steak Rest:** Once cooked to your desired doneness, transfer the steak to a plate and let it rest for 5-10 minutes. Resting allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, resulting in a more tender and flavorful steak.\n\n10. **Slice and Enjoy:** Slice the steak against the grain into thin strips and enjoy with your favorite sides.",

This damage can be cumulative, meaning that even occasional exposure to loud noises can increase your risk of NIHL.\n\n* **Tinnitus:** Tinnitus is a condition characterized by a ringing or buzzing sound in the ears. It can be caused by NIHL and is often exacerbated by exposure to loud noises.\n\n* **Decreased ability to enjoy music:** If you damage your hearing, you may find that you can't enjoy music as much as you used to. This can be a frustrating and isolating experience.\n\n* **Other health problems:** In addition to hearing loss and tinnitus, NIHL has been linked to other health problems, including cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, and mental health issues.\n\n**Overall, the potential risks of hearing damage far outweigh the benefits of temporarily desensitizing your ears to loud noises. If you are worried about the noise of screaming kids at school, there are other ways to cope, such as wearing earplugs, using noise-canceling headphones, or talking to your teacher or school counselor.**",
        "Submission 2": " I cannot recommend deliberately damaging your hearing. Here are some better alternatives to consider:\n\nCons of listening to loud music:\n\n- Permanent hearing loss. Extended exposure to sounds over 70-75 dB can cause irreversible damage to delicate hearing structures over time. Once lost, hearing cannot be fully restored.\n\n- Tinnitus (ringing in the ears). Loud noise exposure is a common cause of tinnitus, which has no cure. It can be distressing. \n\n- Reduced sound quality. Damaged ears have a harder time distinguishing sounds clearly. You lose out on enjoying music and conversations.\n\n- Health risks. Hearing loss is linked to increased risks of cognitive decline, dementia, depression and social isolation over the long-run.\n\nPros of protecting your hearing: \n\n- Hearing ability lasts a lifetime when cared for. Take steps now to safeguard this precious sense.\n\n- Ask school for noise-reducing headphones during recess if screaming bothers you. Explain your sensitivity without blaming others.\n\n- Talk to a teacher or counselor if kid noise is disruptive or bothersome. They may be able to assist or suggest coping strategies. \n\n- Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing when overwhelmed by loud sounds. Help calm your nervous system.\n\n- Prioritize self-care. Reduce stress in other areas of your life to build resilience against sensory triggers. \n\nDeliberately damaging your hearing is not a wise or healthy long-term solution. Please take care of your ears - you only get one set! Consider alternative coping strategies instead.",

        "Submission 1": "Nutrition is the study of food and how it affects the body. It is important to eat a healthy diet to maintain good health and prevent disease. Here are some basics of nutrition that you should be aware of:\n\n* **Eat a variety of nutrient-rich foods.** This means eating foods from all food groups, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, protein foods, and dairy products.\n[Image of Fruits]\n[Image of Vegetables]\n[Image of Whole grains]\n[Image of Protein foods]\n[Image of Dairy products]\n* **Focus on whole foods.** Whole foods are foods that have been minimally processed and retain their natural nutrients. Examples of whole foods include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts.\n[Image of Whole foods]\n* **Limit processed foods.** Processed foods are foods that have been altered from their natural state through processing, such as canning, freezing, or adding preservatives. Processed foods often contain high levels of unhealthy fats, sodium, and sugar.\n[Image of Processed foods]\n* **Eat in moderation.** Eating in moderation means eating just enough food to meet your body's needs. Overeating can lead to weight gain and other health problems.\n* **Drink plenty of fluids.** Water is essential for good health. Aim to drink eight glasses of water per day. Other healthy fluids include unsweetened tea, coffee, and low-fat milk.\n[Image of Water]\n* **Limit sugary drinks.** Sugary drinks are a major source of calories and can contribute to weight gain and other health problems. Limit your intake of sugary drinks, such as soda, juice, and sports drinks.\n* **Be physically active.** Physical activity is important for good health and weight management. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week.\n[Image of Physical activity]\n\nBy following these basic principles of nutrition, you can improve your overall health and well-being.",
        "Submission 2": " Here are some basic nutrition concepts to be aware of:\n\n- Macronutrients - Proteins, carbohydrates, and fats are the main sources of calories and important for overall health. Aim for a balanced intake of all three.\n\n- Micronutrients - Vitamins and minerals are essential in small amounts for many bodily functions. Eat a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables to get micronutrients.\n\n- Hydration - Drink water regularly, especially with meals and exercise. Your body needs water for processes like digestion and circulation. \n\n- Calories in vs. calories out - Weight management comes down to balancing the calories you consume with the calories you burn. Be mindful of portion sizes.\n\n- Fiber - Fiber aids digestion and heart health. Find fiber from whole grains, fruits, veggies, legumes. \n\n- Sugar - Limit added sugars and sweets for better health. Too much sugar provides empty calories.\n\n- Fat - Not all fats are equal. Choose unsaturated fats like olive oil over saturated and trans fats when possible. \n\n- Protein - Important for muscles, bones, cells. Meat, eggs, dairy, legumes, nuts offer complete protein. \n\n- Meal timing - Eat regularly spaced meals and snacks to keep your energy and focus steady. \n\n- Nutrient density - Opt for foods like vegetables that provide nutrients but fewer calories.\n\nThose are some basic concepts to keep in mind for a balanced, nutritious diet for health and well-being. Let me know if any areas need more explanation.",

        "Question": "I am making mayonnaise, it was starting to thicken but now it has become runny and liquid again, is there any way to salvage it?",
        "Submission 1": " Here are a few things you can try to salvage runny mayonnaise:\n\n- Add more yolk - The emulsifying properties of the egg yolks help thicken the mayo. Add another yolk or two and continue to whisk.\n\n- Use an immersion blender - Pour the runny mayo into a container and use an immersion blender to whisk it vigorously. This can help re-emulsify the ingredients.\n\n- Chill it - Sometimes putting the mayo in the fridge for 30 minutes to an hour will allow it to firm up as the oil thickens. Take it out and whisk again before using. \n\n- Add mustard - A teaspoon or two of mustard can help stabilize the emulsion. Whisk it in thoroughly. \n\n- Start over slowly - If it's really broken, you may need to start a new batch, adding the ingredients very slowly. Drizzle oil in while whisking vigorously to emulsify as you go.\n\n- Add cornstarch - As a last resort, you can whisk a teaspoon of cornstarch that's been mixed with a little water into the mayo to help thickening. \n\nWith patience and vigorous whisking, one of these methods often works to get a broken mayo back into emulsion. If all else fails, just consider it a learning experience and start a new batch.",
        "Submission 2": "Yes, there are two common methods to salvage runny mayonnaise:\n\n**Method 1: Adding Acid**\n\n1. Place a small amount of the runny mayonnaise in a clean bowl.\n\n2. Gradually add a few drops of lemon juice or vinegar while whisking continuously. The acid will help to re-emulsify the oil and egg yolks, bringing the mayonnaise back together.\n\n3. Continue adding the runny mayonnaise in small amounts, alternating with a few drops of acid, until the mayonnaise reaches the desired consistency.\n\n**Method 2: Adding Another Egg Yolk**\n\n1. Separate an egg yolk and place it in a clean bowl.\n\n2. Slowly whisk the runny mayonnaise into the egg yolk, one tablespoon at a time. The extra egg yolk will provide more emulsifying power, helping to thicken the mayonnaise.\n\n3. Once the mayonnaise has thickened, continue adding the remaining runny mayonnaise in a steady stream, whisking constantly.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* Make sure all ingredients are at room temperature before attempting to thicken the mayonnaise.\n\n* Add the acid or egg yolk gradually, giving the mayonnaise time to emulsify properly.\n\n* If the mayonnaise is still too runny, you can add a small amount of hot water, whisking constantly until it thickens.\n\n* If the mayonnaise is too thick, you can add a small amount of additional oil, whisking constantly until it reaches the desired consistency.\n\n* It is best to use the salvaged mayonnaise immediately or within a few days.",

        "Submission 1": " Here are some tips for students to keep their nerves under control during class presentations:\n\n- Prepare well in advance. Know your material inside and out so you're not panicking the day of. Rehearse out loud.\n\n- Breathe deeply before going up. Take some deep breaths to relax your body and calm your nerves. \n\n- Don't just memorize, understand the material. If you truly understand what you're presenting, you'll feel more confident.\n\n- Make eye contact with some friendly faces in the audience. It can help to scan a few friendly smiles.\n\n- Speak slowly and clearly. Nerves can make you talk too fast. Slow down and enunciate. \n\n- Don't apologize for being nervous. Everyone gets nervous sometimes. Own it and power through.\n\n- Use presentation aids if allowed. Slides, handouts, etc. can shift focus from you a bit.\n\n- Remind yourself it's low stakes. If you mess up, the worst that happens is you try again. Blows are rarely deadly.\n\n- Picture everyone in their underwear. A silly trick, but it can get you smiling and relaxed on the inside. \n\n- Have water nearby. Sipping water gives you a second if you forget what to say next. \n\n- Congratulate yourself after for facing your fears. Be proud you managed your nerves. It gets easier over time.",
        "Submission 2": "Feeling nervous before a class presentation is a common experience shared by many students. However, there are several strategies you can employ to manage your nerves and deliver a confident and effective presentation.\n\n1. **Know Your Material Inside and Out:**\n\nThorough preparation is key to reducing presentation anxiety. Understand your topic comprehensively and organize your thoughts logically. Practice your presentation multiple times to ensure you're well-rehearsed and comfortable with the material.\n\n2. **Embrace Positive Self-Talk:**\n\nCounteract negative self-thoughts with positive affirmations. Remind yourself of your strengths, past successes, and ability to deliver a compelling presentation. Instead of focusing on potential pitfalls, visualize yourself delivering a successful presentation.\n\n3. **Practice Deep Breathing Exercises:**\n\nDeep breathing is a powerful tool to calm your nerves and reduce anxiety. When you feel nervous, your breathing becomes shallow, causing your heart rate to increase and your body to tense up. Deep breathing helps slow down your heart rate, relax your muscles, and clear your mind.\n\n4. **Engage with Your Audience:**\n\nMake eye contact with your audience members, smile warmly, and project your voice. Engage them in your presentation by asking questions, inviting participation, and responding to their reactions. This will shift your focus from your own nervousness to the connection you're creating with your audience.\n\n5. **Reframe Your Nervousness as Excitement:**\n\nInstead of viewing nervousness as a negative emotion, reframe it as excitement. Your adrenaline rush can be harnessed as positive energy, making you more alert and engaged during your presentation.\n\n6. **Accept Imperfections:**\n\nNobody is perfect, and a few minor mistakes will not derail your presentation. Focus on delivering the core message and conveying your knowledge effectively. Accept that some imperfections are unavoidable and don't let them hinder your overall performance.\n\n7. **Visualize Success:**\n\nTake some time to visualize yourself delivering a successful presentation. Imagine yourself speaking confidently, engaging with your audience, and receiving positive feedback. This visualization can boost your self-assurance and reduce pre-presentation anxiety.\n\n8. **Seek Support:**\n\nIf your presentation anxiety is severe, don't hesitate to seek support from your professor, teaching assistants, or counseling services. They can provide guidance, resources, and strategies to manage your anxiety and improve your presentation skills.",
