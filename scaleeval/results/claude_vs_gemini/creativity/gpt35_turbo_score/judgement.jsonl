        "Reasoning": "Based on the provided criteria, both submissions demonstrate a competent level of logical reasoning. They present well-structured ideas with a logical flow, relevant content, and mostly well-developed arguments. However, there may be occasional lapses in coherence or minor logical fallacies in both submissions. Both submissions are clear, structured, and include consistent logical reasoning, making them easy to follow. Any logical complexities are addressed and explained. \n\nGiven the competent level of logical reasoning demonstrated in both submissions, it is challenging to definitively determine which one is better without further context or specific examples of logical fallacies. Therefore, I would choose \"Neither is better: 0\" as the most appropriate response."
