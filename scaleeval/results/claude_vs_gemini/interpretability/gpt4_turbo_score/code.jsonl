The function name and the return statement are self-explanatory, indicating a good use of meaningful naming conventions. The provided examples are accurate and demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs, aligning well with the 'Very Interpretable' criteria.\n\nSubmission 2, while detailed, contains a critical error in the implementation: it compares the original string to the `reversed` iterator, not a string, which would result in the function always returning `False`.

        "Reasoning": "Both submissions are clear and well-structured, with meaningful variable names and comments that explain the logic. Submission 1 has a more straightforward approach by directly checking if the array is empty and then proceeding with sorting. It uses slicing to copy the array, which is efficient but might not be a deep copy as in Submission 2. Submission 2 uses `copy.deepcopy`, which is unnecessary for a list of non-negative integers since a shallow copy would suffice. However, Submission 2 includes redundant steps, such as assigning `first` and `last` variables, which are not used beyond the sum calculation. Both codes lack comments within the sorting logic, assuming prior knowledge of the `sort()` method and its `reverse` parameter.\n\nConsidering the criteria, Submission 1 is slightly better due to its efficiency and avoidance of unnecessary steps, even though both submissions are almost equally interpretable.\n\n1\n\n1"

The explanation is informative and the code is well-structured, making it easy to understand the logic and flow.\n\nSubmission 2, while also providing a solution, does not align with the problem statement. It incorrectly attempts to convert the integer to binary and sum the digits; instead, it constructs the binary representation of the original number in reverse.
