        "Submission 1": " There are a few possible reasons why the developer tools shortcut (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I) may not be working on that specific website:\n\n- The website has disabled the devtools shortcut. Some sites do this intentionally for security/privacy reasons.\n\n- There is JavaScript on the page intercepting the shortcut key combination before Chrome can handle it. The site code would need to allow the shortcut.\n\n- A browser extension could be interfering. Try disabling all extensions temporarily to test.\n\n- Special browser configurations (e.g. kiosk mode) may block devtools.\n\n- The website could be forcing mobile view emulation which disables some devtools options.\n\nA few things to try:\n\n- Right click anywhere on the page and select \"Inspect\" from the context menu. This will open devtools without the shortcut.\n\n- Add `?debug` to the URL like https://mnsw.pro/?debug - some sites enable more debugging when this param is present. \n\n- Try a different browser like Firefox or Edge to see if the shortcut works there.\n\n- View the page source and check for any JavaScript that might be overriding keyboard shortcuts.\n\nSo in summary, the site itself has likely intentionally disabled or blocked the devtools shortcut for that domain. Right click inspect is a workaround.",

        "Question": "What is the difference between HTML and JavaScript?",
        "Submission 1": " The main differences between HTML and JavaScript are:\n\n- HTML is a markup language used to define the structure and layout of a web page. JavaScript is a scripting language used to add interactive elements and dynamic behavior to web pages.\n\n- HTML is used for presenting content, while JavaScript is used for manipulating and accessing content. HTML provides structure and semantics for the page, JavaScript provides interactivity and behavior.\n\n- HTML is static - it just defines the content and structure. JavaScript adds dynamism by allowing things like modifying HTML elements, responding to events, submitting forms, validating inputs and generally interacting with users. \n\n- HTML lives in the HTML document and is parsed by the browser. JavaScript lives either in <script> tags or external .js files and is executed by the browser. \n\n- HTML elements like <div>, <p>, <img> etc are defined in HTML, while JavaScript adds interactive elements like click handlers, mouse movement listeners etc.\n\n- HTML documents are plain text files, JavaScript files can produce dynamic interactive behavior at runtime based on user interaction and other events.\n\n- HTML provides content, JavaScript provides client-side logic. JavaScript can modify and access HTML elements and their content dynamically.\n\nSo in summary, HTML provides structure and semantics, JavaScript provides interactivity and dynamic behavior to HTML pages. HTML is for markup, JavaScript is for programming browser behavior and logic.",
        "Submission 2": "HTML and JavaScript are both computer languages used to create web pages, but they have different purposes and capabilities.\n\n**HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that defines the structure and content of a web page. It uses tags to tell the browser how to display different elements of the page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. HTML is a static language, meaning that the content of a web page defined in HTML will not change unless the HTML code is changed.\n\n**JavaScript** is a scripting language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It can be used to change the content of a page, respond to user events, and create animations and other effects. JavaScript is a client-side language, meaning that it is executed by the web browser, not by the web server.\n\nHere is a table that summarizes the key differences between HTML and JavaScript:\n\n| Feature | HTML | JavaScript |\n|---|---|---|\n| Type | Markup language | Scripting language |\n| Purpose | Defines the structure and content of a web page | Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages |\n| Execution | Rendered by the browser | Executed by the browser |\n| Dynamic behavior | Static | Dynamic |\n| Cross-browser compatibility | High | High |\n| Embedding | JavaScript can be embedded in HTML | HTML cannot be embedded in JavaScript |\n\nHere are some examples of how HTML and JavaScript are used together:\n\n* A HTML form can be used to collect user input, and JavaScript can be used to validate the input and send it to the server.\n* A JavaScript function can be used to change the color of a button when the user hovers over it with the mouse.\n* A JavaScript animation can be used to create a slideshow or other visual effect.\n\nOverall, HTML and JavaScript are two complementary languages that are essential for creating modern web pages. HTML provides the basic structure and content of the page, while JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.",

First, we need a function to merge two sorted sequences:\n\n```lean\ndef merge (a : list α) (b : list α) (cmp : α → α → bool) : list α :=\n  match (a, b) with\n    | [], [] => []\n    | [], _ => b\n    | _, [] => a\n    | (x :: xs), (y :: ys) =>\n      if cmp x y then x :: merge xs (y :: ys) else y :: merge (x :: xs) ys\n```\n\nThis function simply compares the first elements of the two sequences and recursively merges the smaller sequence with the rest of the larger sequence.\n\nNext, we need a function to find the minimum run size for a given sequence length:\n\n```lean\ndef min_run_size (n : ℕ) : ℕ :=\n  if n <= 32 then n else 32\n```\n\nThis function is based on the observation that Timsort performs best when the initial runs are of a certain minimum size.\n\nNow, we are ready to implement the Timsort algorithm itself:\n\n```lean\ndef timsort (a : list α) (cmp : α → α → bool) : list α :=\n  let n := a.length\n  let min_run_size := min_run_size n\n  let runs := partition_into_runs min_run_size a\n\n  -- Merge the runs until there is only one run left.\n  while runs.length > 1 do\n    let (runs1, runs2) := runs.split_at (runs.length / 2)\n    runs := merge_runs runs1 runs2\n\n  -- Return the final run.\n  runs.head\n```\n\nThis function works by first partitioning the input sequence into runs, which are sorted subsequences. The runs are then merged together until there is only one run left, which is the sorted output sequence.\n\nTo merge the runs, we use the following function:\n\n```lean\ndef merge_runs (runs1 : list (list α)) (runs2 : list (list α)) : list (list α) :=\n  match (runs1, runs2) with\n    | [], [] => []\n    | [], _ => runs2\n    | _, [] => runs1\n    | (run1 :: runs1r), (run2 :: runs2r) =>\n      if run1.length < run2.length then run1 :: merge_runs runs1r (run2 :: runs2r)\n      else run2 :: merge_runs (run1 :: runs1r) runs2r\n```\n\nThis function simply merges the runs in a pairwise fashion, comparing the lengths of the runs to determine which run to merge first.\n\nThis is a basic implementation of the Timsort algorithm in Lean 4. It can be improved in a number of ways, such as by using a more efficient merge function or by implementing more advanced optimization techniques.",

        "Submission 1": " Here is a sample programming problem related to dynamic programming:\n\nProblem: Coin Change\n\nGiven a value 'V' representing the amount of change due, and denominations of coins available (let's say we have coins of values 1, 2, 5, and 10), compute the minimum number of coins needed to make the change amount 'V'.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: V = 11 \nCoins: [1, 2, 5]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Take coins of 5, 2, 2.\n\nInput: V = 4\nCoins: [1, 2, 5] \nOutput: 2 \nExplanation: Take coins of 2, 2\n\nConstraints:\n\n- The denomination values will be unique/distinct positive integers\n- 'V' is always >= 0 \n- One coin can be used multiple times in the composition\n- You may assume that there are infinite coins available for each denomination.\n\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming by building a table where each cell represents the minimum coins needed for that amount. The table is built bottom-up by iterating through the amounts. This utilizes the fact that smaller sub-problems are solved first to optimize the overall problem.",
        "Submission 2": "**Problem:**\n\nGiven a set of coins with different denominations and a target amount, find the minimum number of coins needed to make up the target amount.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n```\nInputs: [1, 3, 5], 11\nOutput: 3\n\nInputs: [2, 5, 10], 12\nOutput: 2\n```\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n* The coins can be used multiple times.\n* The target amount must be non-negative.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThis problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The state of the problem can be defined as a tuple of two integers: (target_amount, current_coin_index). The base case is when the target amount is zero, in which case the minimum number of coins needed is zero. Otherwise, we can either use the current coin to make up the target amount, or we can skip the current coin and try to make up the target amount with the remaining coins. The recursive formula is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef min_coins(target_amount, current_coin_index):\n  if target_amount == 0:\n    return 0\n\n  if current_coin_index >= len(coins):\n    return float('inf')\n\n  # Use the current coin.\n  min_coins_using_current_coin = 1 + min_coins(target_amount - coins[current_coin_index], current_coin_index)\n\n  # Skip the current coin.\n  min_coins_skipping_current_coin = min_coins(target_amount, current_coin_index + 1)\n\n  return min(min_coins_using_current_coin, min_coins_skipping_current_coin)\n```\n\nTo find the overall solution, we simply call the `min_coins()` function with the target amount and the index of the first coin.\n\n```python\ndef main():\n  target_amount = 11\n  coins = [1, 3, 5]\n\n  min_coins_needed = min_coins(target_amount, 0)\n\n  print(f'The minimum number of coins needed to make up {target_amount} is {min_coins_needed}')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n  main()\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nThe minimum number of coins needed to make up 11 is 3\n```\n\nThis problem can be extended to consider additional constraints, such as the maximum number of coins that can be used or the weights of the coins.",

Create a new directory for your project:\n\n```\nmkdir typescript-project\ncd typescript-project\n```\n\n2. Initialize your project as an npm package:\n\n```\nnpm init -y\n```\n\n3. Install the TypeScript compiler as a development dependency:\n\n```\nnpm install typescript --save-dev\n```\n\n4. Initialize a Git repository in your project directory:\n\n```\ngit init\n```\n\n5. Create a `tsconfig.json` file in your project directory. This file will configure the TypeScript compiler. You can use the following default configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"es2020\",\n    \"module\": \"commonjs\",\n    \"strict\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n6. Create a `src` directory in your project directory. This directory will contain your TypeScript source code.\n\n7. Create an `index.ts` file in the `src` directory. This file will be the entry point for your TypeScript application.\n\n8. Add a simple `console.log()` statement to the `index.ts` file:\n\n```typescript\nconsole.log('Hello, world!');\n```\n\n9. Compile your TypeScript code to JavaScript using the following command:\n\n```\nnpx tsc\n```\n\n10. Run your JavaScript code using the following command:\n\n```\nnode dist/index.js\n```\n\nYou should see the following output in your terminal:\n\n```\nHello, world!\n```\n\nYou have now successfully initialized a TypeScript project using npm and git. You can now start adding more code to your project and using the TypeScript compiler to catch errors and validate types.",
        "Submission 2": " Here are the basic steps to initialize a Typescript project using npm and git:\n\n1. Create a directory for your project and initialize an npm project:\n\n```\nmkdir my-project\ncd my-project\nnpm init\n```\n\n2. Install Typescript as a dev dependency: \n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev typescript\n```\n\n3. Create a `tsconfig.json` file to configure Typescript:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"es6\",\n    \"module\": \"commonjs\",\n    \"outDir\": \"dist\",\n    \"strict\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n4. Create a `src` directory for your code and a `index.ts` file:\n\n```\nmkdir src\ntouch src/index.ts\n```\n\n5. Initialize a git repository:\n\n```\ngit init\n``` \n\n6. Add/commit/push your initial files: \n\n```\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\"  \ngit remote add origin <your_git_repo_url>\ngit push -u origin master\n```\n\n7. Add a build script to `package.json` to compile Typescript:\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"build\": \"tsc\"\n}\n```\n\nNow your project is set up to use Typescript with npm and source control with git!",

        "Submission 1": "A basic PyGame project would typically look something like this:\n\n```python\nimport pygame\n\n# Initialize PyGame\npygame.init()\n\n# Create a window\nscreen = pygame.display.set_mode((640, 480))\n\n# Set the window caption\npygame.display.set_caption(\"My PyGame Project\")\n\n# Create a clock to control the frame rate\nclock = pygame.time.Clock()\n\n# Game loop\nwhile True:\n\n    # Check for events\n    for event in pygame.event.get():\n\n        # If the user quits the game, exit the loop\n        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n            pygame.quit()\n            sys.exit()\n\n        # Handle keyboard events\n        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:\n\n            # If the user presses ESC, quit the game\n            if event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE:\n                pygame.quit()\n                sys.exit()\n\n    # Update the game state\n\n    # Render the game to the screen\n    pygame.display.flip()\n\n    # Limit the frame rate\n    clock.tick(60)\n```\n\nThis is a very basic example, but it demonstrates the essential components of a PyGame project:\n\n* **Initialize PyGame:** This must be done before anything else.\n* **Create a window:** This is the surface where the game will be rendered.\n* **Set the window caption:** This is the text that will appear in the title bar of the window.\n* **Create a clock:** This is used to control the frame rate of the game.\n* **Game loop:** This loop runs until the user quits the game.\n* **Check for events:** This is where you will handle user input and other events.\n* **Update the game state:** This is where you will update the game logic, such as moving objects and checking for collisions.\n* **Render the game to the screen:** This is where you will draw the game to the window.\n* **Limit the frame rate:** This is important to do to prevent the game from running too fast.\n\nTo add keyboard event handling to this project, we can simply add a few lines of code to the `event loop` section:\n\n```python\n# Handle keyboard events\nif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:\n\n    # If the user presses ESC, quit the game\n    if event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE:\n        pygame.quit()\n        sys.exit()\n```\n\nThis code will check for keyboard events and quit the game if the user presses ESC.\n\nTo add an FPS counter to the project, we can add the following code to the `render the game to the screen` section:\n\n```python\n# Render the FPS counter\nfps = clock.get_fps()\nfont = pygame.font.SysFont(None, 24)\ntext = font.render(f\"FPS: {fps}\", True, (255, 255, 255))\nscreen.blit(text, (10, 10))\n```\n\nThis code will get the current FPS and render it to the screen in the top left corner.\n\nHere is the complete code for the basic PyGame project with keyboard event handling and FPS counter:\n\n```python\nimport pygame\n\n# Initialize PyGame\npygame.init()\n\n# Create a window\nscreen = pygame.display.set_mode((640, 480))\n\n# Set the window caption\npygame.display.set_caption(\"My PyGame Project\")\n\n# Create a clock to control the frame rate\nclock = pygame.time.Clock()\n\n# Game loop\nwhile True:\n\n    # Check for events\n    for event in pygame.event.get():\n\n        # If the user quits the game, exit the loop\n        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n            pygame.quit()\n            sys.exit()\n\n        # Handle keyboard events\n        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:\n\n            # If the user presses ESC, quit the game\n            if event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE:\n                pygame.quit()\n                sys.exit()\n\n    # Update the game state\n\n    # Render the game to the screen\n    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))\n\n    # Render the FPS counter\n    fps = clock.get_fps()\n    font = pygame.font.SysFont(None, 24)\n    text = font.",
        "Submission 2": " Here is a basic example of a PyGame project that handles keyboard events and displays the FPS counter:\n\n```python\nimport pygame\nimport time\n\npygame.init()\n\n# Define screen size\nSCREEN_WIDTH = 800\nSCREEN_HEIGHT = 600\n\n# Setup display window \nscreen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))\n\n# Game loop\nrunning = True\nstart_time = time.time()\nwhile running:\n\n  # Check for quit event\n  for event in pygame.event.get():\n    if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n      running = False\n    if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:\n      if event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE:\n        running = False\n\n  # Draw FPS on screen            \n  fps = str(int(pygame.time.get_fps()))\n  font = pygame.font.SysFont('Arial', 30) \n  text = font.render(fps, True, (255,255,255))\n  screen.blit(text, (10, 10))\n  \n  # Update display\n  pygame.display.update()\n\n# Quit PyGame\npygame.quit()\n```\n\nThe key things it's doing:\n\n- Initialize PyGame \n- Set up the screen\n- Main game loop \n- Check for quit/esc key events\n- Calculate and display FPS   \n- Update the display\n- Quit PyGame\n\nThis provides a basic template for a PyGame project with keyboard input handling and FPS display.",

        "Question": "Can I compile python code to make it faster?",
        "Submission 1": " Yes, it is possible to compile Python code to make it faster. Here are a few common options:\n\n- PyInstaller - This allows you to package and distribute standalone Python applications as single executable files for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Compiling with PyInstaller produces smaller, bundled apps that don't require a Python installation.\n\n- Py2Exe - Similar to PyInstaller but specifically for Windows. It bundles Python code and dependencies into a single executable.\n\n- Cython - A compiler that converts Python code into C/C++ extensions. This allows Python code to be directly compiled to machine code for faster performance. Cython code runs as fast as C in many cases.\n\n- Numba - A JIT (just-in-time) compiler that can compile Python code into fast machine code at runtime for NumPy-like functions. It compiles Python types to native machine code at runtime for significant speedups.\n\n- PyPy - An alternative Python implementation that uses a tracing JIT compiler to dynamically optimize Python bytecode. PyPy code is often 2-5x faster than CPython for numeric and I/O bound workloads. \n\n- CFFI - Allows interacting with C functions and APIs from Python. Can help optimize specific code bottlenecks by deferring to compiled C code.\n\nSo in summary, options like Cython, Numba, PyPy and CFFI allow compiling Python to C-like speeds, while PyInstaller and Py2Exe bundle it into standalone executables without requiring a Python installation.",
        "Submission 2": "Yes, you can compile Python code to make it faster. However, Python is an interpreted language, so it is not strictly necessary to compile your code in order to run it. In fact, Python interprets your code each time you run it, which can lead to slower execution times.\n\nThere are a few ways to compile Python code:\n\n* **Use a Python bytecode compiler.** This will compile your Python code into bytecode, which is a lower-level representation of your code that can be executed by the Python interpreter more quickly.\n* **Use a Python compiler to create a stand-alone executable.** This will compile your Python code into a stand-alone executable file that can be run without the need for a Python interpreter.\n\nWhether or not compiling your Python code will actually make it faster depends on a number of factors, including the type of code you are writing, the size and complexity of your code, and the platform on which you are running your code.\n\nHere are some general guidelines for when to compile your Python code:\n\n* **If you are writing performance-critical code, such as a numerical computing library or a web server, then compiling your code may be beneficial.**\n* **If you are writing code that will be deployed to a production environment, then compiling your code can help to improve its performance and reliability.**\n* **If you are deploying your code to a platform with limited resources, such as a Raspberry Pi or a mobile device, then compiling your code can help to reduce its size and memory footprint.**\n\nHere are some tools that you can use to compile Python code:\n\n* **py_compile:** This is a standard Python module that can be used to compile Python source files into bytecode.\n* **py2exe:** This is a third-party tool that can be used to compile Python code into stand-alone executables for Windows.\n* **cx_Freeze:** This is another third-party tool that can be used to compile Python code into stand-alone executables for Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nIf you are not sure whether or not you should compile your Python code, then it is generally best to err on the side of caution and leave it uncompiled. You can always compile your code later if you need to.",

        "Question": "what does the @ in python do",
        "Submission 1": "In Python, the `@` symbol is primarily used to denote decorators. Decorators are a powerful tool in Python that allows you to modify the behavior of a function or class without changing its original definition. They are essentially functions that take another function as an argument and return a modified version of that function.\n\nWhen you use the `@` symbol followed by a decorator function, it applies that decorator to the function immediately below it. The decorator function wraps the original function, adding additional functionality before or after the original function's execution.\n\nDecorators are commonly used for various purposes, including:\n\n1. **Adding logging or debugging functionality:** Decorators can be used to automatically log function calls, arguments, and return values, making it easier to debug and trace code execution.\n\n2. **Adding caching mechanisms:** Decorators can be used to store the results of expensive function calls, preventing repeated calculations and improving performance.\n\n3. **Enforcing access control:** Decorators can be used to check for user permissions or restrict access to certain functions based on specific conditions.\n\n4. **Adding additional functionality:** Decorators can be used to add common behaviors to a group of functions, such as converting inputs, formatting outputs, or handling exceptions.\n\nHere's an example of a simple decorator that adds a prefix to the output of a function:\n\n```python\ndef add_prefix(prefix):\n    def decorator(func):\n        @wraps(func)\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            return prefix + func(*args, **kwargs)\n        return wrapper\n    return decorator\n\n@add_prefix(\"Hello, \")\ndef greet(name):\n    return f\" {name}!\"\n\nprint(greet(\"Alice\"))\n```\n\nIn this example, the `add_prefix` decorator takes a `prefix` argument and returns a decorator function. The decorator function takes the original function `greet` as an argument and returns a wrapper function that adds the `prefix` to the output of `greet`. When you call `greet(\"Alice\")`, the wrapper function is executed, resulting in the output \"Hello, Alice!\".",
        "Submission 2": " The @ symbol in Python is used to define decorators. Decorators allow you to modify or extend the behavior of function, method, or class definitions in Python.\n\nSpecifically, @ does the following:\n\n- It indicates that the line below defines a decorator. The decorator must be a valid Python function that takes the function to be decorated as its only argument.\n\n- When a function is defined with a @decorator line in front of its definition, it tells Python to run the function definition through the decorator before creating the actual function object.\n\n- Decorators allow you to wrap additional functionality around a function definition without permanently modifying the function itself. This can be useful for logging, timing, authentication, or other use cases where you want to modify a function's behavior.\n\nSome examples of how @ is used:\n\n```python\n@logging.getLogger(__name__)\ndef my_func():\n  print(\"Hello world!\")\n\n@timer  \ndef long_running_func():\n  # do something time consuming\n\n@authenticated\n@authorize(level=2) \ndef edit_records():\n  # function that requires auth\n```\n\nSo in summary, @ signifies a decorator in Python which allows modifying or extending functions, methods or classes without permanently changing their original definition.",

        "Question": "In TypeScript, how can I tell the type system \"I know that in theory this value may have these multiple types, but in practice I know it will only have this one\"",
        "Submission 1": "TypeScript provides a few different ways to inform the type system that a value has a more specific type than what it would infer based on its declared type. These techniques are known as type guards.\n\n**Type guards** are expressions that evaluate to a boolean value and narrow the type of a variable or expression based on the result. They allow you to convey additional information to the type system about the runtime behavior of your code, enabling it to make more precise type inferences and prevent potential errors.\n\nHere are some common ways to implement type guards in TypeScript:\n\n1. **Type predicates:** Type predicates use the `is` keyword to check if a value conforms to a specific type. For example:\n\n```typescript\nfunction isFish(pet: Pet): pet is Fish {\n  return typeof pet.swim === \"function\";\n}\n\nconst pet: Pet = { name: \"Nemo\", swim: () => {} };\nif (isFish(pet)) {\n  // TypeScript knows that 'pet' is of type 'Fish' here\n  pet.swim();\n}\n```\n\n2. **Custom type guards:** You can create custom type guards using conditional types or type aliases. For instance:\n\n```typescript\ntype StringOrNumber = string | number;\n\nfunction isString(value: StringOrNumber): value is string {\n  return typeof value === \"string\";\n}\n\nconst input: StringOrNumber = \"Hello\";\nif (isString(input)) {\n  // TypeScript knows that 'input' is of type 'string' here\n  input.toUpperCase();\n}\n```\n\n3. **typeof operator:** The `typeof` operator can be used to check the type of a value at runtime. For example:\n\n```typescript\nfunction formatCommandline(command: string[] | string): string {\n  const line = typeof command === \"string\" ? command.trim() : command.join(\" \").trim();\n  // TypeScript knows that 'line' is of type 'string' here\n  return line;\n}\n```\n\n4. **Type assertions:** Type assertions allow you to explicitly cast a value to a specific type. However, they should be used with caution as they can introduce runtime errors if the assertion is incorrect.\n\n```typescript\nconst value: any = 123;\nconst num: number = value as number; // Type assertion\n// TypeScript treats 'num' as a number here\nnum.toFixed(2);\n```\n\nBy employing these type guard techniques, you can inform TypeScript about the actual types of values in your code, leading to more precise type checking and better prevention of potential errors.",
        "Submission 2": " There are a few different ways to handle this in TypeScript:\n\n- Use a type assertion:\n\n  ```typescript\n  let value: string | number;\n  // In practice I know it will be a string\n  const strValue = value as string; \n  ```\n\n- Use a type alias to narrow the type:\n\n  ```typescript\n  type KnownType = string;\n  \n  let value: string | number;\n  const knownValue: KnownType = value;\n  ```\n\n- Cast to a union that only includes the known type:\n\n  ```typescript \n  let value: string | number;\n\n  const knownValue = value as string;\n  ```\n\n- Use a generic function with a constraint:\n\n  ```typescript\n  function process<T extends string | number>(value: T) {\n    // value is string | number\n    // but T constrains it to just string or number\n  }\n\n  process<string>(value); \n  ```\n\n- Refactor the code to avoid the ambiguous type in the first place if possible\n\nSo in summary, type assertions, aliases, casts or constraints can tell TypeScript you know the actual runtime type is narrower than the declared union type.",

        "Question": "Explain the difference between sets and lists in Python.",
        "Submission 1": " Here are the main differences between sets and lists in Python:\n\n- Ordering: Lists are ordered, meaning the elements have a defined ordering and you can access elements by index like a[0], a[1], etc. Sets are unordered, their elements have no defined ordering so you cannot access them by index.\n\n- Membership testing: Membership testing (testing if an element is in the set/list) is much faster for sets since they use a hash table internally. Lists have to check each element for equality using a for loop.\n\n- Duplicates: Lists can contain duplicate elements, sets cannot. If you try adding a duplicate element to a set it will be ignored.\n\n- Mathematical operations: Sets support mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference etc. Lists do not support such operations.\n\n- Mutable vs immutable: Lists are mutable, you can change their elements. Sets are immutable, you cannot change their elements, you can only replace the set with a new one. \n\n- Construction: Lists can be constructed using a list, while sets require unique immutable elements like numbers, strings etc. \n\nSo in summary - lists are ordered, allow duplicates, support indexing but have slower membership testing. Sets are unordered, do not allow duplicates, have faster membership testing but do not support indexing or duplicate elements.",
        "Submission 2": "Sets and lists are both built-in data structures in Python used to store collections of items. However, they differ in several key aspects:\n\n**Ordering:**\n\n* **Sets:** Sets are unordered collections of items. This means that the order in which items are added to a set is not preserved when iterating over the set or accessing its elements.\n\n* **Lists:** Lists are ordered collections of items. The order in which items are added to a list is preserved when iterating over the list or accessing its elements.\n\n**Uniqueness:**\n\n* **Sets:** Sets store only unique items. If an item is added to a set multiple times, it will only appear once in the set.\n\n* **Lists:** Lists can store duplicate items. An item can appear multiple times in a list.\n\n**Mutability:**\n\n* **Sets:** Sets are immutable, meaning that their elements cannot be directly modified after creation. To change the contents of a set, you need to remove and add elements.\n\n* **Lists:** Lists are mutable, meaning that their elements can be directly modified after creation. You can change the values of existing elements or insert and delete elements.\n\n**Access:**\n\n* **Sets:** Sets do not support indexing, so you cannot access elements by their position in the set.\n\n* **Lists:** Lists support indexing, so you can access elements by their position in the list. You can also use slicing to extract sublists from a list.\n\n**Common Operations:**\n\n* **Sets:** Sets support mathematical set operations such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.\n\n* **Lists:** Lists do not support set operations directly. However, you can use list comprehension and other techniques to perform set-like operations on lists.\n\n**Use Cases:**\n\n* **Sets:** Sets are useful for storing unique values, checking for membership, and performing set operations. They are also efficient in finding the intersection or union of two sets.\n\n* **Lists:** Lists are useful for storing ordered collections of items, accessing elements by position, and modifying individual elements. They are also efficient in iterating over their elements.\n\nIn summary, sets and lists are both versatile data structures with different strengths and weaknesses. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of your program. Use sets when you need to store unique values, perform set operations, or check for membership. Use lists when you need to store ordered collections of items, access elements by position, or modify individual elements.",

        "Question": "How to code the snake game in C that will be smooth and it will use images to animate whole level.",
        "Submission 1": "To create a smooth and visually appealing snake game in C, you'll need to utilize graphics libraries like SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) or Allegro. These libraries provide functions for drawing images, handling user input, and managing game loops. Here's a general outline of the process:\n\n1. **Initialize Graphics:** Set up the graphics library, create a window, and load the necessary images for the game, including the snake body segments, food, walls, and background.\n\n2. **Game Loop:** Implement a main game loop that continuously updates and renders the game state.\n\n3. **Snake Movement:** Handle user input to control the snake's direction. Keep track of the snake's position and update it accordingly.\n\n4. **Collision Detection:** Check for collisions between the snake and food, walls, or its own body. If the snake eats food, increase its length and place new food randomly. If the snake collides with a wall or itself, end the game.\n\n5. **Image Drawing:** Use the graphics library's functions to draw the game elements onto the window. Update the snake's body position and draw the new segments accordingly.\n\n6. **Smooth Rendering:** To achieve a smooth animation, use a fixed timestep for the game loop. This ensures that the game updates at a consistent rate, regardless of the system's performance.\n\n7. **Game Over:** When the game ends, display a game over message and handle any necessary cleanup.\n\nRemember to include appropriate error handling and memory management throughout your code.",
        "Submission 2": " Here are the basic steps to code a snake game in C that uses images to animate smoothly:\n\n1. Plan the game layout and design. Decide on the size of the grid, number of levels, images to use etc. \n\n2. Create image files for the snake, food, walls/obstacles if any. Optimize the images for smooth animation.\n\n3. Include graphics libraries like SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) which allow displaying and manipulating images. \n\n4. Define structures to store game state - snake position/length, direction, speed, current level details etc.\n\n5. Initialize graphics - open window, load images, set time interval for frame rate. \n\n6. Draw initial board - walls/level design using image tiles. \n\n7. Main game loop:\n   - Get user input to change direction \n   - Move snake by changing head position\n   - Check for collision with boundaries/self\n   - Draw snake at new position using image\n   - Check for food collision, grow snake\n   - Draw food at random empty spot\n   - Update score\n   - Clear/redraw screen\n   - Cap frame rate \n\n8. Handle level transitions, scoring, game over conditions.\n\n9. Release graphics resources and quit on exit.\n\n10. Use multithreading if needed for smooth animation without lag.\n\nThe key is optimizing image loading, clearing only dirty portions for redraw and capping frame rate for smooth animation using graphics libraries. Proper game logic and state management is also important for a polished snake game.",

        "Question": "You are given an algorithm or a search query about coding. Look for a code snippet related to the search query.\n\nPython loop",
        "Submission 1": "Python programming offers two primary types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops. Both serve different purposes and are essential for controlling repetitive tasks in your code.\n\n**For Loops**\n\n`for` loops are primarily used to iterate over a sequence of items, such as a list, tuple, or string. They execute a block of code for each item in the sequence. The basic syntax for a `for` loop in Python is:\n\n```python\nfor item in sequence:\n  # code to execute for each item\n```\n\nFor example, the following code snippet prints each number from 1 to 10:\n\n```python\nfor number in range(1, 11):\n  print(number)\n```\n\nThis code snippet iterates over the range of numbers from 1 to 10, assigning each number to the variable `number` in each iteration. Inside the loop, the `print` function displays the current value of `number`.\n\n**While Loops**\n\n`while` loops, on the other hand, are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a given condition remains true. The syntax for a `while` loop in Python is:\n\n```python\nwhile condition:\n  # code to execute while condition is true\n```\n\nFor instance, the following code snippet prints the numbers from 1 to 10, incrementing by 2 each time, until the value reaches 15:\n\n```python\nnumber = 1\nwhile number <= 15:\n  print(number)\n  number += 2\n```\n\nThis code initializes a variable `number` with the value 1. The `while` loop checks if `number` is less than or equal to 15. If true, the loop executes the code block, printing the current value of `number` and then adding 2 to it. The loop continues until `number` becomes greater than 15, at which point it terminates.",
        "Submission 2": " Here is a basic Python for loop code snippet:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nfor number in numbers:\n    print(number)\n```\n\nThis loops through the list 'numbers' and prints each number. Some key points:\n\n- for loops in Python are used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects.\n\n- The variable 'number' is the iteration variable that will take on each value from the sequence in turn. \n\n- The code block indented below the for loop body is executed each iteration with the iteration variable 'number' changing each time.\n\n- This allows you to easily loop through and access each element of a sequence without having to use indexes like in other languages.\n\nHope this helps provide a simple example of how to use a basic for loop in Python!
