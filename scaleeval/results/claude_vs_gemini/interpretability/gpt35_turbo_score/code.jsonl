The variable and function names effectively convey their purpose. The code is generally interpretable, but there are some areas that could benefit from additional comments and explanations.\n\nSubmission 2: The code also demonstrates a clear structure with explanations and meaningful naming conventions. The code is mostly interpretable, but there are some areas that could be further clarified with additional comments.\n\nBased on the evaluation, both submissions are moderately interpretable, but Submission 1 has slightly more comprehensive and informative explanations, which enhances its interpretability.\n\nTherefore, I choose \"1\".\n\n1"

        "Reasoning": "Based on the criteria provided, both submissions demonstrate a satisfactory level of interpretability. Submission 1 features a step-by-step explanation of the implementation process, utilizing built-in functions and a clear explanation of the logic. However, it lacks a detailed explanation of variable and function names. Submission 2 also provides a clear implementation with a step-by-step explanation, including the rationale behind the code. It also uses meaningful variable and function names, ensuring a better understanding of the code's purpose. Considering these aspects, Submission 2 is slightly better due to its use of clear and meaningful naming conventions, which enhances the overall interpretability.\n\n2"

Clarity of Explanations: Submission 1 provides a clear and detailed explanation of the Pythagorean theorem and how it relates to identifying a right-angled triangle. It uses specific examples and clearly explains the conditions for determining a right-angled triangle. Submission 2, on the other hand, lacks detailed explanations and does not provide as much clarity regarding the application of the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n2.
