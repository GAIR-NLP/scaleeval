criteria:
  math_reasoning:
    "1": "Beginning - The response demonstrates a fundamental lack of mathematical reasoning. Solution is entirely incorrect or unrelated to the given problem."
    "2": "Developing - The response exhibits some understanding of the relevant mathematical principles but is marred by significant errors in approach or computation. Any glimpse of correct method or logic is overshadowed by misapplication or ambiguity, or omission of critical steps."
    "3": "Competent - The response reflects a sound understanding of the mathematical nature of the problem, employing mostly accurate methods and deriving plausible solutions. Minor computational errors or omissions may occur, and while the steps are clear, the detailed explanations or nuances might be insufficient or imprecise."
    "4": "Proficient - The response is characterized by logical coherence and accuracy, closely aligning with the mathematical principles relevant to the question. It outlines a clear and systematic approach to the solution but may occasionally fall short of providing in-depth insights or exploring alternative methods."
    "5": "Mastery - The response exemplifies mathematical precision and comprehensive understanding. It not only delivers an accurate and insightful solution but also illuminates underlying concepts, highlights potential pitfalls, and offers nuanced insights, significantly enhancing the user's comprehension of the subject."

  code_reasoning:
    "1": "Beginning - The code fundamentally lacks logical structure and relevance to the user's problem. It does not compile or is filled with errors, with explanations that fail to clarify its intent or approach."
    "2": "Developing - The code hints at addressing the user's query, but contains mistakes and flawed logic. The structure might have a basic form, but it's often overshadowed by critical errors or redundant portions. Explanations are minimal."
    "3": "Competent - The code is a commendable attempt, functioning with some bugs or inefficiencies. The logic is mostly consistent, offering a solution that could use some optimization. Explanations are present, guiding understanding to a degree, but might overlook certain complexities."
    "4": "Proficient - The code is logically sound, efficiently tackling the user's problem using best practices. It is organized and peppered with helpful comments that guide comprehension. Solution is largely optimized and well-explained, but there might still be room for minor improvements."
    "5": "Mastery - The code stands as a paragon of best programming practices. It's flawless in functionality, optimized for performance, and handles every conceivable edge case. The solution serves a clear purpose, and explanations are thorough, illuminating every rationale behind the code's design."
  logical_reasoning:
    "1": "Beginning - The response demonstrates a severe lack of logical reasoning. Ideas or arguments presented are disconnected, lack coherence, and are riddled with inconsistencies. It is difficult to follow and largely irrelevant to the topic at hand."
    "2": "Developing - The response showcases some attempts at logical reasoning, but are underdeveloped or superficial. While there are glimpses of structured thought, the ideas often lack cohesion or rely on faulty logic. The arguments or ideas are partially formed, leaving significant gaps."
    "3": "Competent - The response reflects a standard application of logical reasoning. Ideas are mostly structured and show a logical flow, but there might be occasional lapses in coherence or minor logical fallacies. The content is relevant, and the arguments or ideas are mostly well-developed, though deeper logical exploration could enhance them."
    "4": "Proficient - The response stands is clear, structured, and includes consistent logical reasoning. Ideas or arguments are well-thought-out, supported by evidence or well-reasoned assumptions, and presented in a coherent manner that's easy to follow. Any logical complexities are addressed and explained."
    "5": "Mastery - The response exemplifies the highest standards of logical reasoning. Every idea or argument is meticulously structured and backed by impeccable logic. The content addresses the topic comprehensively and addresses potential counterarguments or complexities, demonstrating a deep/robust understanding of logical reasoning."
